## Overview

The Echo Below is a Tier 1 campaign for 3–5 characters using the Daggerheart TTRPG system and set in [[Scorval Blight]] in the custom world of [[Velthuryn]].


It explores resonance scars, fractured communities, and the choices characters must make as they descend beneath Uled into the depths of the mine.  

The story is built to be flexible: GMs can adapt the pacing, focus on different factions, and scale adversaries depending on the group.

The Echo Below is not a dungeon crawl — it’s a story about community, memory, and the cost of delving into the past.

Key distinctions:
- A **living town hub** (Uled) with factions, conspiracies, and social tension.
- A **road segment structure** that builds escalation as the party travels.
- A **sandbox midsection** for freeform play and investigation.
- A **mine finale** where all threads converge.
## Tone and Themes
**Tone**: Dark but wondrous. The campaign should feel heavy with memory, grief, and mystery, but with flashes of fragile hope.

**Themes**:
  - Hope vs. Fear as literal forces
  - Memory and forgetting
  - Bargains and betrayal
  - Echoes as both danger and revelation

## Principles for the GM
- Center **Hope & Fear** in every roll and scene.
- Make **resonance visible and audible**: whispers, shards, and echoes shape the fiction.
- Keep the **stakes personal**: the story matters because of what characters stand to lose or protect.
- Use **scenes of reflection** to contrast danger with quiet moments.

## Inciting Incident
The saboteur’s attack in Uled sets the campaign in motion.  
The party begins entangled in conspiracies, rumors, and hazards before their descent begins.  

The first session establishes:
- Uled as a fractured community
- The presence of Hollowbound forces and other factions
- The dangerous resonance that shapes everything

## Special Mechanics

The campaign introduces mechanics for the GM to heighten play:
- **Suspect Matrix**: track suspects, clues, and shifting suspicions.
- **Elastic Pacing Toolkit**: adjust how quickly or slowly the descent progresses.
- **Faction Heat**: escalating consequences as groups react to PC actions.
- **Echo Hazards**: environmental effects that threaten memory, body, or law.
