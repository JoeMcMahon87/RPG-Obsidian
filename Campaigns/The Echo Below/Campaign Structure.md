# Campaign Structure

## Six Nights of Echoes
The campaign is structured across **six sessions (“nights”)**, each escalating the threat of resonance and the saboteur’s schemes.

- **Night 1**: Uled – introduction, sabotage, first echoes.  
- **Night 2**: Road south – Saltglass Forest, suspicions grow.  
- **Night 3**: Road ridge – Trill-Hollow, investigation deepens.  
- **Night 4**: Baled – sandbox of faction conflict and sabotage clues.  
- **Night 5**: Road mineward – closing the circle, tightening consequences.  
- **Night 6**: The mine finale – confrontation and resolution.

## Master Timeline
The GM tracks how the saboteur’s plans and faction tensions unfold:

1. **Sabotage sparks crisis** – attack in Uled.  
2. **Rumors spread** – Heat escalates, factions point fingers.  
3. **Travel to Baled** – conspiracies branch outward.  
4. **Faction confrontations** – Hollowbound, Cradlekeepers, conspirators.  
5. **Mine crisis** – sabotage culminates, resonance surges.  
6. **Resolution** – bargains, betrayals, or survival.

> **GM Note:** The timeline is elastic — adjust pacing and escalation depending on group engagement.

## Choosing & Shaping the Saboteur
The **saboteur** is the central antagonist of the campaign.  
They may be:
- A conspirator from the appendix  
- A local from Uled or Baled  
- A faction-aligned traitor  

**Guidance**
- The saboteur should be someone the PCs meet early.  
- Their motives should reflect themes of memory, betrayal, or resonance.  
- Keep their identity ambiguous until Session 4 or 5.  

**GM Tools**
- Use the **Suspect Matrix** to track suspicion.  
- Drop clues gradually — some true, some misleading.  
- Let player choices steer who is guilty.

## Session Prep Checklists
Each session has a **prep checklist**:

- **Establish hooks**: NPCs, rumors, echoes.  
- **Track faction Heat**: who gains, who loses.  
- **Update Suspect Matrix**: add new evidence or suspicion.  
- **Review location hazards**: echoes, resonance storms, environmental threats.  
- **Ready adversaries**: adjust to Tier 1 PCs.  
- **Plan one reflection moment**: a quiet beat to highlight Hope & Fear.  

> **Tip:** Keep prep light; let PCs’ questions and suspicions drive the flow.

## Elastic Pacing Toolkit
The campaign is designed with **elastic pacing**.  
You can expand or compress scenes based on time and player interest.

- **Stretch** by:  
  - Adding extra travel events  
  - Expanding faction confrontations  
  - Deepening NPC suspicions  

- **Compress** by:  
  - Skipping minor encounters  
  - Letting the saboteur’s actions escalate faster  
  - Folding multiple clues into one revelation  

Always keep the **six-night arc** intact — but let the tension rise or fall with the table’s energy.

## Scaling & Time Compression
Adjust difficulty and length depending on your group:

- **Scaling adversaries**: Increase or decrease Hit Points, Fear moves, or reinforcements.  
- **Shortened campaign**: Compress to 3–4 sessions by combining travel segments.  
- **Extended campaign**: Expand each road segment into 2+ sessions with added hazards and NPCs.

## Milestones & Rewards
Milestones trigger after key events, not just combat.

**Examples**
- Survive the sabotage in Uled  
- Convince a faction ally in Baled  
- Expose or capture a conspirator  
- Descend into the mine’s core  

**Rewards**
- Level up through milestone XP  
- Gain faction favors or resources  
- Unlock special Hope/Fear features tied to resonance
