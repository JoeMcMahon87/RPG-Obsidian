# Session 3 — Road II: Trill-Hollow Ridge

## Overview
The party ascends the Trill-Hollow Ridge, a knife-edge road of pale granite where griefglass resonance 
distorts sound and sight. Shrines, fissures, and wind-hollowed caverns conceal both cult corruption and 
false trails. Here the PCs will confront faction suspicion, echoes of their own choices, and a cult ritual 
that could open a resonance fissure beneath the ridge.

## Session Goals
- Escalate resonance weirdness (echoes mimicking the PCs’ own voices).
- Tie in Forge Keepers’ silence (rumors, symbols, prisoners’ traces).
- Force the PCs to parse true clues vs. false leads.
- Spotlight each PC with tailored challenges.
- End with a ritual-site climax that tests combat, puzzle-solving, and morality.

## Arrival Script (Player-Facing Read-Aloud)
The road climbs into a pale ridge where the wind never rests. It combs across granite so dry 
and bare it gleams like bone, whistling through cracks with a thin, mournful note. Pools of 
water cling in shallow depressions, each one mirror-bright, holding the sky like a second 
world. Below, salt flats and dead marshes stretch under a bruised horizon. From somewhere 
unseen, faint metallic chimes drift up — uneven, like glass struck with bone. Even the gull 
cries seem wrong, too sharp, too delayed, as though the ridge itself were mocking your 
ears.
