# Beat 5 — Ritual Site Climax

## Narrative Intro
The ridge opens to a clearing gouged in granite. Pools mirror the sky, rippling out of sync. Five violet sigils blaze, cultists chant, cracks of violet fire spread. The air quivers — a fissure about to tear.

## The Challenge
Goal: PCs prevent fissure from opening.  
Options:
- Violent Disruption: combat cultists. Fear spawns Echo-Beasts.
- Puzzle Disruption: sigil puzzle (3 successes before 2 fails). Knowledge/Spellcast DC 15.
- Faction Complication: Hollowbound may arrive, accuse PCs.

## Cultists & Ritual Mechanics
- Chant cycle: surviving cultists roll Presence vs DC 11. 3 stages = fissure opens.
- Actions: reinforce sigil (requires double disruption), chant-lash attack.

## PC Spotlights
- Iris: cultist begs mercy, choice to kill/spare.
- Gashier: smash embersteel anchors.
- Bokoko: rechannel chaos spiral.

## GM Tools & Adjustments
- Split approaches (combat+puzzle) force tradeoffs.
- If PCs falter: spend Fear to escalate (echo-voices, Hollowbound arrival).
- Creative alternatives allowed, with Stress/Clock cost.

## Outcomes
- Success (Hope): fissure collapses clean.
- Success (Fear): fissure closes, but scar/backlash (Echo-Beast).
- Failure: fissure tears wider, violet energy spews, Clock +1.

## Closing Image (Player-Facing)
“The chanting ends with a shriek of shattering resonance...”

## Encounters
- Cult Ambush Squad (scales with PCs).  
- Echo-Sigil Warden.  
- Hollowbound Patrol.  
- Echo-Beast (Fear complication).

## GM Fear Uses
- Voices whisper false choices.
- Hollowbound arrive mid-scene.
- False lead seems true.
- Spawn echo-beast.
- Advance ritual clock.

## Session Transition / Rest Period
- If fissure closed clean: uneasy quiet, Forge Keeper bell tolls faintly.
- If botched: forest hums, fissure unstable.
- PCs may rest, recover Stress/HP.
- Horizon: smoke from Baled, bells toll faintly.
