# Beat 5 — Ritual Site

## Narrative Intro
The ridge finally opens onto a clearing gouged into the granite...  

## The Challenge
- Goal: prevent fissure opening.  
- Options: Violent disruption, Puzzle disruption, Faction complication.  

## Cultists & Ritual Mechanics
- Chant cycle: advance ritual.  
- Cultist actions: reinforce sigil, chant-lash attack.  

## PC Spotlights
- Iris: choice to spare or kill begging cultist.  
- Gashier: smash embersteel anchors.  
- Bokoko: rechannel chaos.  

## GM Tools & Adjustments
- Split approaches = divide actions.  
- Falter → spend Fear to escalate.  
- Creative alternatives allowed, but with cost.  

## Outcomes
- Success (Hope): fissure collapses cleanly.  
- Success (Fear): fissure collapses, but scar/backlash.  
- Failure: fissure tears open wider.  

## Closing Image (Player-Facing)
“The chanting ends with a shriek of shattering resonance...”
