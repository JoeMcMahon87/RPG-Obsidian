> **Narrative Intro**
_At the crest of the ridge, you come upon a scatter of stone shrines. Each is little more than a cairn of granite slabs, once etched with prayers for lost travelers. But now the stones are cracked, daubed with violet sigils that pulse faintly in rhythm with the wind. Offerings — coins, beads, scraps of food — have been scattered across the dirt. Some are smeared with dried blood. A crooked figure sits among the shrines: a hermit with a tangled beard, rocking back and forth, muttering to himself as though in prayer. The wind carries his words into the same rhythm as the cult markings, echoing like half-remembered hymns.

## Scene Hooks & Mechanics
- Examine Carvings (Knowledge/Instinct DC 13).
- Pray/Meditate (Presence/Spirit DC 12).
- Speak to [[Hermit Caretaker]] (Presence DC 11).


### [[Cult Agent]] (Optional Encounter)
- Violet-eyed cultist ensuring shrines stay corrupted. Fear Spend: tries to pulse shrine violently.

## GM Options & Adjustments
- If PCs Deface Shrines: Hermit wails, +Heat, resonance backlash (Instinct DC 12 or Stress).
- If PCs Attempt Restoration: lower Heat, Hermit may aid, protective charm possible with Hope.
- If PCs Ignore Shrines: echoes linger, next Fear → whispers accuse.

## Outcomes / Transitions
- Best Case: PCs connect blood → resonance power, glimpse Silent Bell clue.
- Mixed: contradictory evidence (Hollowbound vs Cradlekeepers).
- Worst: hostility, +Heat.
- Transition Narration: depends on PCs’ actions (restore, deface, ignore). All lead toward the fissure.
