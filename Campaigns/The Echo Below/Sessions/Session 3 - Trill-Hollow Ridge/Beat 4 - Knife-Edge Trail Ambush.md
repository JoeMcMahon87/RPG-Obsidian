> **Narrative Intro**
_The ridge narrows to a path barely wider than your shoulders. Cliffs plunge into mist on either side. Wind claws constantly, loosening stones. Ahead, the path bends; shapes move against the horizon. The trail feels like a trap.

## Scene Hooks & Mechanics
- Traverse Trail (Agility/Valor DC 12). Fail → slip, Stress, lost gear.
- Spot Ambush (Instinct DC 13). Success → detect cultists/courier. Fail → surprised.
- Intercept Courier (Agility/Finesse DC 14). Success → coded message. Fail → courier escapes, Clock +1.

## NPCs & Complications
- Cultist Ambush Squad (2–3 rank-and-file). Delay PCs, protect courier.
- Courier (Faction choice). Carries coded message implicating wrong suspect. Fear Spend: glider-cloak escape.
- Optional Hollowbound Patrol. May accuse PCs mid-encounter.

## PC Spotlights
- Iris: hears conflicting whispers. Presence DC 12.
- Gashier: anchors party. Strength DC 13.
- Bokoko: collapses trail. Spellcast DC 15.

## GM Options & Adjustments

- Reckless: ambush hits first, fall hazard.
- Hollowbound: creates three-way standoff, social tension.

## Flavor Cues
- Sound: wind repeats PCs’ words.
- Sight: shadows duplicate bodies.
- Touch: vibrating cliffside.

## Outcomes / Transitions
- Best: secure courier + message.
- Mixed: message damaged, +Heat.
