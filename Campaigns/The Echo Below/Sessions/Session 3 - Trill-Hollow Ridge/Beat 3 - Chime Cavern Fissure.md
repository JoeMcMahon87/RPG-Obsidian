> **Narrative Intro**
_The ridge narrows to a cleft in the stone, where the wind whistles down into darkness. Beneath your boots, a wide fissure splits the granite like a wound, its edges crusted with violet dust. Each gust of wind stirs a chorus of metallic chimes. Pools ripple in sync, showing distorted reflections. Far below, the faint glimmer of crates and cloth catches the light.
