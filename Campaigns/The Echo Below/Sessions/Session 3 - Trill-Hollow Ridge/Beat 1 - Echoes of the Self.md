> **Narrative Intro**
_The wind does not just whistle through the ridge — it speaks. At first you think it is birdsong carried strangely, but then you hear words: your own voice, echoing across the rocks. It repeats choices you never made — bargains refused, prisoners killed, allies betrayed. Each gust brings another contradiction, until the air itself feels thick with lies that sound too much like truth.

## The Challenge
- Instinct Roll (DC 13): Hold focus and resist resonance disorientation.
- Knowledge Roll (DC 14): Identify that the echoes are resonance manipulations, not memory loss.
- Presence Roll (DC 12): Rally companions, calm the group, keep them moving.

## Spotlights & Personal Echoes
- Iris: Hears himself sparing the cultist… and also killing him. Each echo accuses the other choice.
- Gashier: Hears a voice boasting about breaking the embersteel lock on the crates — before he’s even seen them.
- Bokoko: Hears their own laughter echoing back twisted, followed by spell incantations they don’t remember casting.
- Optional GM Spend (Fear): Echoes speak secrets — things PCs never told aloud (draw from Session 2 or player backstory).

## Echo Lines Table
### Iris
1. “You let him live. Weakness is its own betrayal.”
2. “You slit his throat already. We all saw the blood.”
3. “The prisoner begged you. You enjoyed denying him.”
4. “The Core sings your mercy like a hymn — but not a kind one.”

### Gashier
1. “You broke the lock before. Do it again, before they see.”
2. “Your axe slipped. You didn’t mean to kill him… did you?”
3. “Chains are nothing. You wear worse than they do.”
4. “You promised to protect them — and you failed.”

### Bokoko
1. “That spell wasn’t yours. We whispered it to you.”
2. “You already carved the sigils. Look at your hands.”
3. “Magic obeys you? No — it laughs at you.”
4. “The fissure waits for your spark. Will you give it?”

### Generic / Group Echoes
1. “One of you cuts the rope again tonight.”
2. “You freed the Forge Keepers. You left them to rot. Which is true?”
3. “Your names already echo in the mind below.”
4. “You came here to save the coast. You came here to feed the Core. Both cannot be true.”

## Options to Adjust to PC Decisions
- If PCs Ignore the Voices: whispers louder, -1 to next roll, NPCs may later repeat “confessions.”
- If PCs Confront Directly: Presence/Spellcast DC 13 to silence; Fear doubles echoes.
- If PCs Split Up: conflicting outcomes, paranoia deepens.
- If PCs Use Tools/Items: griefglass shards intensify, prayers yield cryptic visions.

## GM Flavor Options
- Echoes arrive seconds late, as if time staggered.
- Pools shimmer with lip-synced reflections.
- Fear Spend: Villain Clock +1 or PCs mark Fear from whispers.

## Outcomes / Transitions
- Success: realize trickery, clarity restored.
- Failure: paranoia lingers, group +1 Fear, time lost.
- Transition: echoes fade as shrines come into view.
