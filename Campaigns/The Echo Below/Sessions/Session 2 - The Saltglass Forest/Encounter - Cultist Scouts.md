### Setup
- Fanatic leads sigil work.  
- 2 Scouts hidden nearby.  

**For 4 PCs at Tier 1:**
- 1 [[Cultist Fanatic]] (Standard)  
- 2 [[Cultist Scout]] (Minions)  

> **Narrative (Scout Revelation)**
_A hiss cuts through the ash-thick air—like a whisper carried on a broken echo. From the treeline, a cloaked figure emerges, bark sigils still glowing faintly behind them. Their eyes gleam with violet reflection, lips moving in a rhythm you can’t hear, as though reciting a prayer swallowed by the forest. They spread their arms wide, palms marked with ash, voice lilting low:
**“The Core stirs beneath Baled… the forest hums its name. You shouldn’t have followed.”**
Branches crack behind you—shadows moving wrong. You’re not alone in this camp.

### Tactics
- Fanatic unsettles PCs with speech.  
- Scouts ambush with daggers.  
- If Fanatic captured → cryptic truths.  
- If Fanatic dies → sigils flare, misleading toward Reliquary.

### Dialogue Snippets
**Fanatic**  
- “The crates are only fuel. The Core is the fire.”  
- “Your names already echo in the mine below. You just haven’t died yet.”  
- “Blood is nothing but resonance waiting to be sung.”  
- [if captured] “You think chains silence us? The Core will answer for me.”  

**Scouts**  
- “The Core hungers—your deaths are hymns!”  
- “Break their throats before they can lie!”  
- [if losing, panicked] “No… no, the vision promised we would triumph!”

### Outcomes
- **Victory:** PCs gain prisoner or writings linking crates to “priests of the Core” (Proof).  
- **Failure/Escape:** Cultists vanish → +1 Heat. Sigils remain.  
- **False Lead:** Sigils misattributed to Reliquary if failed check.  
- **Tone:** Cultists embrace death as devotion; menace lies in certainty.
