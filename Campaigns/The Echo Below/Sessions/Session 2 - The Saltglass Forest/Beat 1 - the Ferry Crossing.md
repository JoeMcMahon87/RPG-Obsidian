>**Narrative**
_The road drops steeply toward a sluggish, grey-green river. Mist curls off its surface, thick as smoke, clinging to pines that lean over the banks. A rope ferry sways at its moorings, bumping dully against the dock with each sluggish push of current. Its timbers groan, and the ropes strain like an old man’s joints.
At the landing, a hunched ferryman waits. His coat is patched, his hands raw with rope-burns. He chews on something bitter, spitting into the water with a nervous glance your way. For a moment, you hear a bird trill above the river. Then—an echo of the same call, a half-beat too late, as though the forest is mocking the sound. Even the silence seems doubled here.

- **Voice Cue:** Thin, cracked, mutters like he’s chewing gravel.
- **Motivations:** Wants trouble to pass him by. Knows smugglers but fears naming them.
