## ðŸ§¾ Session End Deliverables
- **Proof Clue:** Crate fragments, ferrymanâ€™s testimony, or resonance-infected warblers.  
- **False Lead:** Reliquary evidence OR Hollowbound knife.  
- **Tone Shift:** PCs should leave Session 2 uneasy, uncertain of ally vs. enemy, and aware that resonance corruption is spreading beyond Uled.

# ðŸŒ‰ Transition Options (Session 2 â†’ 3)

### 1. The Forest Gives Way (Atmospheric)
> _The Saltglass Forest thins, its resin-thick pines fading into wind-scoured ridges. Mist clings low, curling over stone like pale smoke. Ahead, the road tilts sharply upward, a knife-edge ridge where griefglass shrines glint faintly violet in the failing light.  Somewhere in the gusts, you swear you hear chanting â€” or perhaps itâ€™s only the wind through hollow stone.  

*Use When:* Direct tonal shift from forest paranoia to ridge isolation.  

---

### 2. Echo-Storm Warning (Supernatural Escalation)
> _As you prepare to leave the forest behind, the air grows sharp with ozone. A sudden shudder passes through the trees, and every warbler shrieks at once â€” your voices overlapping theirs in a deafening chorus. The sky bruises violet for a heartbeat, then stills.  
When silence falls again, the ridge road is ahead, and you feel the land itself waiting.  

*Use When:* Villain Clock +1, foreshadows resonance storms in Session 3.  

---

### 3. Faction Interference (Social Hook)
> _Before you clear the treeline, you catch sight of riders â€” Hollowbound patrols sweeping the ridge road. Their commander spares you only a glance before pressing onward, but the message is clear: factions are already moving to control the path to Baled.  The ridge awaits, and with it, the weight of their suspicion.  

*Use When:* PCs interacted heavily with Wythe, Bria, or the Wardens in Session 2.  


### 4. Echo of the Mine (Visionary Hook)
> _As night falls on the forestâ€™s edge, you dream â€” or perhaps simply slip sideways into the hum of griefglass. For a heartbeat, you all see the same thing: a shrine on the ridge, its stones cracked and bleeding violet light. A sigil pulses there, half familiar, half alien.  When you wake, the ridge is before you, and the dream feels less like prophecy than warning.  


*Use When:* Emphasize Jora Vaelâ€™s influence and the cultist thread, supernatural hook for Session 3.
