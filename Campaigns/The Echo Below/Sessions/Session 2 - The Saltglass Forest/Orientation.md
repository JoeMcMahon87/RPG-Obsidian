## üå≤ Atmosphere & Tone
- **Mood:** Damp, resin-scented, and full of doubled echoes.
- **Phenomena:** Every sound feels ‚Äúoff.‚Äù Bird calls repeat wrong. Voices lag. Shadows move out of sync.
- **Tone Dial:** Lean into paranoia. Even when nothing happens, let the PCs feel watched.

> **Read-Aloud: Edge of Uled**
_The morning mist clings stubbornly to Uled‚Äôs crooked rooftops as you gather at the southern gate. Behind you, shutters crack just enough for wary eyes to watch your leaving. The reliquary bell remains silent, its tower a black silhouette in the haze. No farewell toll, no blessing ‚Äî only absence.
_Ahead, the road narrows into ruts of gravel and mud, cutting a pale scar toward the grey-green river. Beyond it, the Saltglass Forest waits, its resin-dripping branches shrouded in doubled echoes.
_You catch sight of the masts at the docks through the mist. Ropes dangle loose, cut clean, their frayed ends still marked by faint sigils. The stolen crates are gone ‚Äî every one bound for Baled. The thought gnaws: was it smugglers, priests, or something worse moving them south?
_The path skirts the abandoned orphanage before bending toward the river. Its bricked windows stare blankly, empty sockets where children once lived. Whispers say some vanished into the forest, others into the mine. Vale‚Äôs words ring unbidden in your memory: ‚ÄúThe mine stirs.‚Äù
_The three of you set out, boots sinking into damp ruts as Uled fades into mist. The ferry landing is visible in the distance, a low raft swaying against its moorings, waiting to carry you across the sluggish river. Between here and there, the road dips steadily, lined with resin-heavy pines whose shadows stretch too long for the morning light.
_Bird calls rise ‚Äî then repeat a beat too late, like someone rehearsing your memory. Even your own footsteps feel doubled. The Saltglass Forest looms closer with every step, its silence thick and uncanny. Whatever waits beyond the river, it already knows you are coming.
