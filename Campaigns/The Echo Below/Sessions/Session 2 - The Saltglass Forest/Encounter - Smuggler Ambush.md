Setup
- Smugglers concealed in treeline (Far range).  
- Ambush triggers when PCs investigate camp.  

**For 4 PCs at Tier 1:**
- 1 [[Smuggler Captain]] (Standard)  
- 3 [[Smuggler]] (Minions)  

> **Narrative (Ambush Trigger)**
_The clearing holds its breath. Ash drifts in slow spirals from the half-burned camp, curling through the mist like smoke that refuses to die. A whistle cuts the silence—then repeats, half a beat late. Figures step from the trees, weapons already bared. Crossbows leveled, blades glinting in the dim light, soot smeared across their faces. These are not startled wanderers—they came hunting. At their center, a scarred brute drags his cutlass across a crate shard, the scrape shrieking too long in the air. He fixes you with eyes like flint.
**“You’ve seen enough. Drop what you found… or bleed into the ash with the rest who asked questions.”**

### Tactics
- Captain closes quickly to melee.  
- 1 Smuggler fires from Far; 2 flank with blades.  
- If losing, Minions flee while Captain covers.

### Dialogue Snippets
**Captain**  
- “The ash eats all who pry. You’ll be no different.”  
- “Your blood will feed the fire they started here.”  
- “Think you’re hunters? Wrong woods.”  
- [if wounded] “Damn you… paid enough to die, but I’ll drag one of you down first.”  

**Minions**  
- “Cut ‘em down quick—less to bury!”  
- “The crates ain’t worth your lives!”  
- “They weren’t supposed to fight back!” [fearful]  
- “Captain, we should run—this isn’t worth it!”  
- [crossbowman firing] “One bolt for each of ya. Pray I miss, ‘cause it hurts worse when I don’t.”

- **Proof Clue:** SG Δ crate shards.  
- **False Lead:** Reliquary tools hidden under ash.
