> **Narrative**
_The trees close in again, resin-dripping trunks crowding the path until only thin light filters through the mist. High above, a chorus of birdcalls ripples through the canopy—sharp, short trills. Then a second chorus follows, just half a beat behind, pitched slightly too low, as if the forest itself were echoing the sound.
When you speak, the same thing happens. Words repeat faintly overhead, bent just enough to be wrong. The effect is immediate and unsettling—like listening to your own memory stumble. The longer you linger, the more the calls overlap, creating a rising cacophony that makes it difficult to tell which voices are real.
