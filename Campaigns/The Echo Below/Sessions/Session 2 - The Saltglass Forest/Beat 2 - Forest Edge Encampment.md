> **Narrative**
_The pines thin into a clearing marked by blackened stumps and ash-scarred earth. What was once a campfire circle is now a half-burned ruin—tents collapsed, cooking gear twisted by heat. Crates lie shattered among the soot, their lids marked faintly with the triangle glyph “SG Δ.” Bark on nearby trees has been carved with jagged sigils, their edges blackened as if the wood itself recoiled from the blade. The air smells of resin, wet ash, and something sharper—like griefglass ground too fine to see.
