Uled serves as the **starting hub** for the campaign.  
It is a fractured river-port town where echoes of griefglass and Hollowbound control weigh heavily.

- **Tone**: Wary, suspicious, and tense.  
- **Role**: Anchor point for Session 1, setting the tone of conspiracy and resonance.  
- **Hooks**: NPC ties, rumors, faction pressure, and the initial sabotage.  

> **GM Note:** Use Uled to make the players care about the community before pulling them into the descent.

### Sound Scenes ([https://bit.ly/45zbYr2](https://bit.ly/45zbYr2))

- **Base Layer**: Low wind through crooked streets, distant gulls doubled in echo, faint trickle of water.
- **Accents**: Lantern glass rattling, wagon wheels crunching salt-stained cobbles, murmured voices hushed.
- **Special Cue**: A sudden silence, followed by a single reliquary bell toll cut short, as if swallowed.

### **Arrival Script**

The tide pulls hard against the piers, mooring ropes groaning as dockhands scramble under the lantern light. The smell of salt and coalfire clings to the air, while bells from the mirrorwell temple ring dully through the fog. Hollowbound Warden patrols pass in silence, their armor gleaming wet in the mist. All around, you sense that Uled is watching you—each conversation, each shadow a little too sharp for comfort. Lanterns burn pale in the daylight, their glass panes etched with protective runes, though many gutter as if tired of their own light. The streets are narrow and uneven, paved with salt-streaked stone that crunches faintly underfoot.

Through the fog, the town slowly reveals its heart. To the east, a pale column of stone rises where the **Mirrorwell Temple** stands, its polished surface reflecting torchlight and faces alike, as if it remembers more than it shows. To the west, smoke from the_ **Reliquary Forge** seeps into the sky, edged with violet proof that griefglass is still being worked, law or no law. The **Taproot Inn** crouches low nearby, lantern-glow spilling into the street where dice and drink trade hands as quickly as rumors. Above, the iron bulk of the **Hollowbound Garrison** towers over the crooked streets, its lanterns cutting sharp lines through the mist. And ahead, the harbor cranes groan against their chains, their nets swaying like giants stirring in uneasy dreams.

A_s your boots meet the cobbles, heads turn. Dockhands pause in their labor, children dart past without laughter, and every shadow seems to carry a watcher’s gaze. Uled does not welcome strangers; it measures them, weighing their worth or their guilt. A gull’s cry doubles in the mist, echoing back on itself, and you feel the unsettling truth that Uled is not greeting you at all. It is listening. Out of the fog step two travelers together: Iris, draconic eyes flashing, still unsettled from a recent confrontation with a high-ranking official; and Bokoko, the quiet Simiah wizard who ended the matter in silence before anyone could see. Their shared secret binds them already. Not far away, a broad-shouldered figure disembarks from a sloop — Gashier, returned after years abroad, his presence earning muttered greetings and sharp stares in equal measure._

A sudden shout cuts the harbor’s rhythm. A dockhand stumbles, spilling a crate of Concord-marked tools across the stones — and his finger points straight at the newcomers. “Them! Saw ’em near the cargo road! Maybe they know where the rest went!” The Hollowbound seize the excuse instantly, fanning out with lanterns high, chains rattling as they bar the way forward. Their officer steps up, voice sharp enough to cut the mist.

**Warden Officer:** “You lot — names and purpose. Cargo’s gone missing, and it’s mighty convenient you arrive just as it vanishes. We’ve no patience for drifters and fortune-seekers. Speak now, or be hauled in.”

The crowd murmurs. Among the whispers, one dockhand mutters to another: “Wasn’t Gashier once in training with one of their Wardens — Stoker, wasn’t it? If that’s true, this could get messy quick.” The words spread like ripples on the tide, binding past and present together as every eye turns to see how the three newcomers will answer. Beyond the checkpoint you face, Uled stretches out in fog and smoke — a place of echoes, hunger, and eyes that see too much.

**Party 1 – Post-entry Hook**

The Warden patrol waves you through at last, chains clinking as the mist swallows them again. The crooked streets open ahead, leading toward the harbor where cranes creak and dockhands scurry. Yet something is wrong: stacks of cargo sit uneven, tarps flapping loose, and workers argue in hushed, frantic tones. A foreman shouts, “They were here at dawn! Concord seals, bound for Baled! Now the whole line’s gone!”

A ring of dockhands parts just enough to reveal an empty stretch of stone where heavy crates should be. The mooring ropes are cut clean — not frayed — and violet dust lingers faintly on the wet cobbles. Iris feels the echo before she sees it: a low thrum in her bones, like a spell’s aftertaste. Bokoko notices patterns in the cut rope, deliberate knots and sigils etched faintly into the wood, as though someone cloaked the theft in arcane misdirection. Both can sense this is more than smuggling.

The Hollowbound bark orders nearby, but their officer looks strained. Whispers ripple through the crowd: that smugglers hauled it off by night, that the Reliquary forged false seals, that the mine itself called its griefglass cargo back. The Taproot’s gamblers are already trading bets on what really happened. For Stoker, this is a matter of duty — missing Concord goods mean someone in Uled will pay dearly. For Gashier, it reeks of the troubles he came home to solve. For Bokoko and Iris, the resonance energy clings to their skin, almost daring them to look deeper.

All eyes turn to the newcomers on the cobbles. Will they stay quiet, let the Wardens bungle the search, or step forward into the heart of Uled’s first mystery?

A Warden officer breaks from the shouting, lantern swinging in one hand as he strides toward you. His armor clinks with damp chains, and his eyes narrow as they pass over each of you in turn.

**Warden Officer (gruff, impatient):**  
“You lot, Stoker, some of you came in on the road just now, didn’t you? Then you saw something. No one slips this much cargo without help. Dockhands are useless, and my patrol’s stretched thin. If you know anything about these crates, speak it plain — or find out quick. The Council won’t wait long before they start naming scapegoats.”

He leans closer, lowering his voice just enough to carry weight.

**Warden Officer:**  
“And Uled loves to blame outsiders.”

### **Dockmaster Korrin (pragmatic, weary)**

Korrin chews on a strip of dried fish as he sizes the party up, voice flat as the tide.  
**Korrin:** “Don’t let the Wardens fool you — this isn’t the first shipment that’s gone missing. Smugglers, sure, but the cuts on those ropes? Clean. Too clean. Someone with coin and craft is behind this. You want answers? Don’t waste your breath in the Garrison. Check the Taproot. That’s where the deals get made.”

### **Bria ‘Lockjaw’ (smuggler captain, sardonic)**

Leaning against a stack of barrels, Bria grins sharp and bitter, smoke curling from the roll-up between her fingers.  
**Bria:** “Wardens lose cargo all the time — only difference now is the seals were Concord’s. Makes it a scandal instead of business-as-usual. If you want to go hunting crates, be my guest. But don’t mistake every shadow for a thief. Sometimes things walk off on their own in this town.”  
_(She laughs, but her eyes flick toward the Reliquary Forge, hinting at another lead.)_

### **Cradlekeeper Zealot (muttering seer’s voice)**

A Cradlekeeper in violet-threaded robes clasps a shard of griefglass to his chest, eyes glassy.  
**Cradlekeeper:** “You hear the silence too, don’t you? The bells falter, the dust stirs, the cargo sings its way home. You call it theft, but it is only return. The earth below Uled is hungry, and it has begun to eat.”  
_(If pressed, he insists the crates were swallowed by the mine’s echoes, not stolen.)_

### **Optional Beat — Warden Underling (defensive, insecure)**

A younger Warden scowls, trying to look braver than he feels.  
**Warden:** “Don’t listen to them. This is smuggler work, clear as day. We’ll find who did it. Unless… you four aren’t here to cover for someone?”
