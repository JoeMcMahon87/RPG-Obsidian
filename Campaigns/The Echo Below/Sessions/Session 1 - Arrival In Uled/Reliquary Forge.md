# **Sound Scenes:**

- **Base Layer:** **Roar of furnaces, rhythmic bellows, hammer striking anvil with long echo.**
- **Accents**: Chains creaking overhead, sparks crackling, buckets of water hissing as metal quenches.
- **Special Cue**: A hammer blow that resonates too long, fading into a low hum that suggests griefglass influence.

Once a thriving workshop, now repurposed as a reliquary.

- Forged tools hang as votive offerings.  
- Shards of griefglass are set in iron frames, humming faintly.  
- PCs may sense **sabotage ties** or find dangerous materials.  

>**Arrival Script:**
>_The Reliquary Forge crouches low on the edge of the market, its stone walls blackened with soot and streaked with violet ash. The air grows hotter the closer you come, thick with iron, coal, and something sharperâ€”like glass ground to powder. Within, the roar of the furnaces is a living thing: bellows exhale with the weight of a beast, and sparks leap high enough to cling to the rafters like tiny stars. Smiths labor bare-armed, their faces sheened with sweat and griefglass dust, each hammer blow ringing too long, as though the sound itself is unwilling to die. Chains hang from the beams, suspending crucibles and half-shaped ingots that shimmer faintly even in shadow. A reliquary bell hangs cracked above the main hearth, silent now, but its presence makes every strike feel like an offering._
