**Sound Scenes**

- **Base Layer**: Crackling hearth, low murmur of voices, clink of mugs on wood.
- **Accents**: Dice clattering across a scarred table, lute string plucked and slightly out of tune, chair scraping.
- **Special Cue**: Conversation drops suddenly, then resumes in whispers when PCs enter — signaling unease.

A central gathering point in Uled.  
The inn is a **social hub** for travelers, locals, and conspirators alike.

- Rumors surface here, often whispered between drinks.  
- PCs may find allies, information, or suspicion in its crowded hall.  
- Scenes here are excellent for planting **clues about the saboteur**.  

> **Arrival Script:**  
> _The Taproot Inn crouches low against the wind, its walls dark with old pine pitch and its roof sagging under moss and slate. Lanternlight spills out in narrow bands through shuttered windows, painting the mud of the street in long golden stripes. Inside, the air is thick with woodsmoke and boiled root-broth, heavy enough to cling to your clothes. Rough-hewn beams—gnarled, like roots pulled from the earth—arch overhead, carved with protective sigils that have been traced and retraced until the wood shines with grease from countless hands. The inn hums with subdued life: miners hunched over clay mugs, dice clicking against scarred tables, and a bard’s lute straining against the weight of so many weary silences. The hearth is warm, but the eyes that turn to you from the shadows are not._
