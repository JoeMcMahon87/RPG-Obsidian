### **Trigger**

While the PCs are moving through Uled’s market (especially during a Heat Event or while investigating smugglers), a **Lantern Failure** plunges a section of the square into half-shadow. In the flicker, a lone **Formych worker** is seen crawling between stalls.

---

### **Narrative**

> _The market stalls shudder as lanterns sputter, light shrinking to a thin violet haze. From beneath a fishmonger’s table, something pale and chitinous scuttles—a Formych worker, its carapace scarred and its mandibles clacking softly. The crowd shrieks and parts, but the creature does not flee toward the gates. Instead, it pauses, antennae raised, as if sniffing out something only it can sense._

### **GM Orientation**

- This is not a combat-ready swarm but a **single displaced worker**, likely drawn by griefglass resonance.
- The Hollowbound will treat its presence as proof of sabotage; smugglers may seize the panic as cover.
- The Formych is _more frightened than hostile_, but its mere presence escalates fear.

---

### **Options for PCs**

- **Capture it** (Valor or Agility 13): Restrain without harming. Success → a clue: the Formych carries dust with the **same violet shimmer as the mine’s sealed tunnels**.
- **Drive it off** (Presence 12 to command the crowd, or Finesse 13 with thrown objects): Success → lowers Fear at cost of +1 Heat (violence in public).
- **Observe it** (Instinct 11): Success → PCs notice its movements mirror the **mine’s pulse rhythm**, hinting at deeper resonance.
- **Kill it outright**: Automatic success, but **Fear +1** for all PCs, and Hollowbound suspicion spikes (+2 Heat).

### **Clocks & Heat Hooks**

- **Villain Clock** +1 if the Formych escapes into the city unseen.
- **Heat** +1 if the crowd panics and blames the PCs.
- **Fear** trigger: Any PC within arm’s reach of the Formych makes Instinct 11 or gains +Fear (whispered echo-voice in their head).
