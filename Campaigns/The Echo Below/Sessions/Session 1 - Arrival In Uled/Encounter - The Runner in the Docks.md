- **Trigger:** PCs uncover smuggler activity (e.g., SG-Δ crates). A dockhand suddenly bolts toward the maze of alleys, carrying a manifest slip.
- **Countdowns:**
    - **PCs’ Progress Countdown:** d6 set to 6 (they must close distance).
    - **Runner’s Escape Countdown:** d6 set to 4 (they have a head start).
    - Tick down PCs’ countdown on successes; tick down runner’s on failures or Fear results.

### **Chase Complications (roll d6 or pick each round)**

1. **Fishmonger’s Stall Overturned** – Agility 12 to vault, Valor 13 to smash through. Failure → +1 Heat as bystanders yell.
2. **Lantern-lit Alley** – Instinct 12 to spot the correct turn; failure → runner gains +1 countdown tick.
3. **Warden Patrol Crossing** – Deception 13 to blend in, Presence 12 to bluff. Fail → Heat +2.
4. **Rooftop Shortcut** – Finesse 13 to scramble up. Success with Hope → advance 2 ticks; fail → take d6 damage.
5. **Crowded Market Surge** – Agility 14 to weave through. Failure → lose 1 Hope
6. **Storm Drain Leap** – Valor 13 to clear the gap. Failure → runner countdown –1.

### **Scene Outcomes**

- **PC Countdown reaches 0 first:** PCs tackle/corner the runner → gain a **Clue Token** (runner’s manifest stamped SG-Δ).
- **Runner Countdown reaches 0 first:** Runner slips into a skiff and vanishes north toward open water → the PCs lose time (Villain Clock +1, Heat +1). They may still recover rumor fragments: _“The Core already left the harbor.”
### **Narration**

> _A deep shudder runs through the cobbles beneath your feet — at first subtle, then rattling every shutter and lantern. The reliquary bells in the Mirrorwell Temple explode into sound, not in harmony but all at once, as if the town itself were struck. The air grows heavy, thick with the taste of metal and salt, and your vision fractures: for a heartbeat, you’re standing somewhere else — tunnels plunging downward, veins of griefglass burning faint violet, passages branching in impossible angles. Then, just as suddenly, you’re back in Uled, the bells still tolling, the echoes fading._

### **GM Tools Behind the Screen**

- **Villain Clock +1**: Mark it immediately — this is the saboteur’s work stirring resonance in the mine.
    
- **Vision = Free Clue**: Each PC sees a **fragment of the mine’s layout**. Give each player _one distinct detail_ (so they must share and piece it together). Examples:
    
    - “A spiral staircase carved into raw stone, leading downward.”
        
    - “A wide cavern, with chains dangling from the ceiling.”
        
    - “A narrow passage where violet dust falls like snow.”
        
    - “A locked iron gate stamped with a Concord sigil.”
        
- **Fear Trigger**: Optionally, ask for **Instinct 11** checks. On a miss, a PC gains +Fear — the echo whispers their _own name_ back at them from the tunnels.
