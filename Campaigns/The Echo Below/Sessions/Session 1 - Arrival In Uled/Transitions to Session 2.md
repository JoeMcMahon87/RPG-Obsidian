# Transitions to Session 2

Choose a transition based on how Session 1 ends and the table’s tone:  
- **Proactive PCs** → use [[Refugee Plea]] or [[Rumor Trail]].  
- **Heat spikes** → use [[Hollowbound Escort]] or [[Forced Departure]].  
- **Mystical tone desired** → use [[Seismograph Spike]].

## Transition Scene 1 — The Rumor Trail

**Orientation**
- PCs piece together rumors at the Taproot Inn, Harbor, or Forge.  
- Emphasize partial truths that point toward Baled, but keep them slanted.  

**Arrival Script**
> _The clatter of dice and hushed voices fades as one whisper cuts through:  “They say the saboteur’s shipments always vanish down the ridge road. Never see them come back, never see the coin.”  Eyes dart toward you, then away. The words are bait, but they lead in only one direction—toward Baled.  

**GM Tools**
- **Clock Hooks**:  
  - Rival overhears and follows them.  
  - False lead planted by saboteur’s ally.  
- **Heat Triggers**:  
  - PCs ask too many questions openly.  
  - PCs accuse the wrong NPC.  
- **Hooks/Outcomes**: Rumor is enough to push them on the road, but clarity comes only mid-journey.

## Transition Scene 2 — The Hollowbound Escort

**Orientation**
- A curfew or crackdown pushes PCs to leave.  
- Hollowbound offer “escort” through the Saltglass edge.  

**Arrival Script**
>_Steel-shod boots strike in unison as Hollowbound wardens march through the square, lanterns guttering violet.  A crier’s voice cuts the air: “By edict, all unregistered travelers must depart Uled at once.”  A mirrored helm turns toward you, reflecting your face with empty eyes. An escort waits at the gate, chains clinking softly.  

**GM Tools**
- **Clock Hooks**:  
  - Escort commander keeps a ledger of names (clue or leverage later).  
  - Patrols report suspicious PCs to Baled authorities.  
- **Heat Triggers**:  
  - PCs resist orders openly (+1 Heat).  
  - PCs attack or abandon escort—rumor spreads quickly.  
- **Hooks/Outcomes**: Faction tension seeded for future Baled encounters.

## Transition Scene 3 — A Refugee Plea

**Orientation**
- Refugees become companions, burdens, or mysteries on the road.  
- Emotional, human hook; possible disappearance mid-journey.  

**Arrival Script**
> _At the edge of the reliquary fire, a woman cradles a child too still for sleep. Her eyes find yours—desperate, unblinking.  “Please… take us as far as the ridge road. I’ll tell you what I saw in the mine. Just don’t leave us here.”  In her lap, a scrap of parchment bears crude maps and half-scratched warnings.  

**GM Tools**
- **Clock Hooks**:  
  - Refugees vanish overnight, boots left behind.  
  - Child begins to hum the Core’s pulse unconsciously.  
- **Heat Triggers**:  
  - PCs refuse or exploit refugees.  
  - PCs argue about safety loudly—word spreads.  
- **Hooks/Outcomes**: Compassion vs. pragmatism; refugees may bring both clues and complications.

## Transition Scene 4 — The Seismograph Spike

**Orientation**
- A supernatural tremor ties Uled directly to the mine.  
- Vision compels PCs to follow the ridge road.  

**Arrival Script**
> _The ground shudders underfoot. Temple bells toll wildly, their notes warped, bending like molten glass.  For a heartbeat, the air itself fractures—your eyes fill with images of tunnels spiraling into violet glow, a great heart beating in the dark.  Then it’s gone. The bells fall silent. Every gaze in the square turns to the ridge road, as if the whole town felt the same pull.  

**GM Tools**
- **Clock Hooks**:  
  - PCs share fragmented visions, argue over meaning.  
  - NPC witnesses echo the PCs’ words back at them later.  
- **Heat Triggers**:  
  - PCs reveal their visions aloud.  
  - PCs defy the temple by leaving during curfew.  
- **Hooks/Outcomes**: Mystical momentum into Session 2; visions foreshadow later mine scenes.

## Transition Scene 5 — The Forced Departure

**Orientation**
- Violence erupts in the market or docks.  
- PCs must choose sides—or simply survive.  

**Arrival Script**
> _Shouts erupt in the market. Crates crash, spilling griefglass dust into the air.  A smuggler’s knife flashes, and wardens answer with steel. The crowd surges like a wave, pressing you toward the ridge road.  In the chaos, a single truth becomes clear: Uled will not let you linger.  

**GM Tools**
- **Clock Hooks**:  
  - Market stalls collapse, blocking escape routes.  
  - Smuggler leader marks PCs as friend or foe.  
- **Heat Triggers**:  
  - PCs strike Hollowbound openly.  
  - PCs aid smugglers, gaining +1 Heat with wardens.  
- **Hooks/Outcomes**: Sets NPC attitudes in Baled depending on who the PCs aided or defied.
