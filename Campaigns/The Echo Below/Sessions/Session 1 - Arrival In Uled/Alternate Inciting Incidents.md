### **Option 1 — The Vanished Crates**

> _“The harbor has been uneasy all week. Dockhands swear crates marked with Concord seals — griefglass bound for Baled — vanished in the night. The cranes swing empty, wardens demand answers, and rumors fly faster than gulls. Some say smugglers made off with the shipment, others claim the mine itself called it back. Whatever the truth, the missing cargo is the talk of every tavern and market stall. Someone will need to find where it went — and soon.”_

### **Option 2 — The Silent Bells**

> _“The reliquary bells of Uled have always marked the hours, their tones rolling over the town like steady breaths. But now, the bells toll strangely — once, twice, then a faltering silence. In the quiet that follows, more than one townsfolk swears they heard something echo back from deep below. Fear takes root quickly here; people mutter of omens, sabotage, and worse. The Council wants someone brave enough to uncover what silences the bells before panic spills into the streets.”_

### **Option 3 — The Factions in Shadow**

> _“In Uled, trust is in short supply. The Hollowbound tighten curfews, smugglers whisper in the Taproot Inn, and the Cradlekeepers preach doom in the square. Each faction points its finger at another, certain sabotage and betrayal are already in motion. The air in the markets is sharp with suspicion; every lantern’s gutter feels like a warning. To bring peace — or at least order — someone must sort truth from rumor and uncover proof before the town tears itself apart.”_
