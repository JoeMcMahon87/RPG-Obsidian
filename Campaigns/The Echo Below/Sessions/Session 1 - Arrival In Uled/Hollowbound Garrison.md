**Sound Scenes:**

- **Base Layer:** **Steady tramp of boots, armor clinking, low drone of wind caught in battlements.**
- **Accents**: Commanding voices barking orders, quills scratching on parchment, chains rattling faintly.
- **Special Cue**: Violet lanterns flicker, emitting a sharp resonance tone instead of a crackle when disturbed.

>**Arrival Script:**
> _The Hollowbound Garrison rises like a blunt fist above Uled’s crooked streets, its stone walls too new and too clean for a town so weathered. Iron lanterns hang from every corner, their violet light cutting sharp angles across the cobbles, leaving no shadow unexamined. A pair of wardens stands at the gate in lacquered armor, their mirrored helms hiding their eyes but not the weight of their gaze. Beyond the open portcullis you glimpse a courtyard drilled flat by boot heels, banners snapping in the wind with the sigil of the Hollowbound: a chain encircling an empty circle. The air here smells of oil, steel, and dried herbs used to mask the scent of griefglass. As you pass, the guards do not move, but you feel measured all the same—like ore on a scale, waiting to be weighed and found wanting._
