**Sound Scenes:**

- **Base Layer:** **Lapping water against piers, gulls crying (with faint echo), ropes straining on wooden posts.**
- **Accents**: Cranes creaking, cargo nets swinging, occasional splash of something unseen in the water.
- **Special Cue**: Chains groan suddenly, dropping a hook or net with a metallic crash — startling everyone nearby.

>**Arrival Script:** **
>_The harbor spreads out in a horseshoe of black stone piers, where the tide licks at the pilings with a sound more like whispering than surf. Salt crust glitters across the cobbles, clinging to boots and ropes alike, and the air is heavy with brine, fish oil, and rust. Looming above the docks are the cranes—iron skeletons with arms like broken giants, swaying on chains that creak even when there’s no wind. Cargo nets dangle half-filled, swinging slowly as if rocked by unseen hands, while gulls wheel and scream overhead, their cries oddly doubled in the mist. Sailors work in silence, their faces pinched and pale, while smugglers and Hollowbound wardens alike keep to the shadows of the warehouses, watching one another with hard eyes. The entire harbor feels tense, as though it could grind to a halt if anyone breathed too loudly._
