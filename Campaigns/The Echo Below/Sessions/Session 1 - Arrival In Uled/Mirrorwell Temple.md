**Sound Scenes:**

- **Base Layer**: Stillness with faint trickle of water, echo chamber reverb effect on all sound.
- **Accents**: Braziers hissing faintly, robes brushing across stone, whispered prayers barely audible.
- **Special Cue**: Unnatural “mirror” echo — a PC’s voice repeats a second later, distorted, from the well.

>**Arrival Script:** 
>_At the far end of Uled, where the cobbled streets thin into gravel, a column of pale stone rises from the mist: the Mirrorwell Temple. Its surface is polished smooth, reflecting torchlight and faces back at you with unsettling clarity, as if the stone itself remembers every passerby. Water trickles constantly from cracks in its foundation, flowing into a broad, still basin that serves as the temple’s heart. The pool does not ripple—even in the wind—yet shadows shift across its surface in ways that don’t match your movements. Fragrant herbs smolder in braziers at the edges, their smoke clinging low and heavy, sweet enough to sting the throat. Priests in grey robes pad silently between columns, their eyes lowered, though you sense they see more than they reveal. The air here tastes metallic, like griefglass dust dissolved in rain, and the longer you look into the well’s surface, the more it feels like something on the other side is looking back._
