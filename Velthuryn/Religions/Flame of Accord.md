A monotheistic faith venerating Narak-Thur, the fire god of discipline and wrath.

## Core Belief
The Flame of Accord teaches that fire is the ultimate arbiter — it tempers oaths like steel, punishes betrayal with wrath, and demands discipline from all who swear in its light.

## Regional Practices
- **Tarkhos Dominion**: Central faith; underpins embersteel forging and the engraving of contracts. Oaths are sworn in flame, and broken promises punished by ritual burning or branding.  
- **Velkar Spires**: Integrated with storm-worship; vows tested in lightning and flame, fire seen as a sibling force to storm.  
- **Ohlai Steppe**: Practiced alongside Bone-Root Way and Spirits Between; mingles with orcish blood-oaths and Katari moon-rites, with fire invoked as purifier of false speech.  

## Details
- **Deity**: Narak-Thur, god of fire, discipline, and wrath.  
- **Nature of Worship**: Monotheistic; emphasizes fire as test, purifier, and weapon.  
- **Attributes**: Wrath for oath-breakers; strength and endurance for the faithful.  
- **Presence**: Recognized as one of Velthuryn’s major religions, with footholds in both eastern highlands and steppe territories.
