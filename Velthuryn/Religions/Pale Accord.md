A polytheistic cult venerating whispered deities of transformation and secrecy.

## Core Belief
The Pale Accord teaches that identity is a burden to be shed. By abandoning names, faces, and histories, adepts embrace secrecy, silence, and transformation until nothing remains to be judged or bound.

## Regional Practices
- **Aeterron**: Hidden cult activity beneath civic iteration, whispered through invention-rites.  
- **Fleaspark Union**: Cult operates more openly, mingling with spark-guilds and secrecy brokers.  
- **Scorval Blight**: Major covenant. Adepts carve their names into griefglass prisms at moonrise; to speak the name again shatters the prism and the self. Silence Pulses from the Aethergrave are harvested into reliquaries as holy absence.  
- **Bastion of Aurex**: Cult present but suppressed by Sunvault and Archive authorities.  

## Details
- **Nature**: Polytheistic; whispered deities, never named directly.  
- **Attributes**: Transformation, secrecy, silence, and self-erasure.  
- **Presence**: Active in Scorval, suppressed in Aurex, hidden in Aeterron, and tolerated in Fleaspark.  
- **Aethergrave Role**: Cult seeks to dissolve all identity into the Grave, seeing annihilation as divine unity.
