A Polytheistic faith venerating star, tide, and moon spirits who sing reality into being.
## Core Belief
The world is shaped by cosmic hymns; tides and lunar cycles carry prophecy.

## Regional Practices
Harmonizing with surf and shell-horns, predicting drowned ruins, interpreting moon/tide songs.
- **Torral:** Galapa tide-chanters, Song of the Sixth Wave.
- **Sunlash Coast:** Tidekin beacon-keepers and chronal singers.
- **Thirasil:** Star-legends and eclipse rites tied to Tassaryn and Cyressel.
## Details

- Worship expressed through festivals like the [[Moonpetal Revel]].  
- Notable Rite: Song of the Sixth Wave, choristers, led mostly by Galapa tide-chanters, wade waist-deep at dawn and harmonize with shell-horns; their song predicts which drowned ziggurats will rise that cycle.
