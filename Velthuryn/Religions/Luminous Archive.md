A polytheistic faith venerating the scriptorium gods of knowledge and record.

## Core Belief
The Luminous Archive teaches that truth must be recorded to endure. Memory is fragile, but inscription, codex, and archive preserve divine order. To worship is to write, debate, and preserve knowledge.

## Regional Practices
- **Lexharrow**: Script-houses teach universal literacy; Orc Ink-Oath Masters inscribe incorruptible sigils; debates at Aurenhold’s High Colleges decide civil authority.  
- **Gravenreach**: Dwarves engrave law into stone and griefglass, aligning Archive principles with ancestral oath-stones.  
- **Aeterron**: Civic law requires contributions of processes or algorithms; invention-rites and proof courts reinforce iteration as sacred duty. Outsiders refusing contribution are branded “Idle.”  
- **Bastion of Aurex**: Archive entwined with Sunvault Covenant; prism-scriptures and heliographs record laws in light, balancing zeal with inscription.  

## Details
- **Nature**: Polytheistic; gods personify aspects of knowledge, record, and preservation.  
- **Attributes**: Writing, debate, and inscription treated as acts of faith.  
- **Civic Role**: Functions as both religious and legal system across multiple states.  
- **Presence**: One of the major religions of Velthuryn, with centers in Lexharrow, Gravenreach, Aeterron, and Aurex.
