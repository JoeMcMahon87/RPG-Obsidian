A monotheistic faith venerating Solivar, god of radiant law and divine order.

## Core Belief
The Sunvault Covenant teaches that Solivar’s light is truth and law. Radiance reveals what is hidden, binds oaths, and burns away falsehood. Shadow is error; to live rightly is to walk in the light.

## Regional Practices
- **Lexharrow**: Paired with the Luminous Archive; heliographs and beacon-lit tribunals affirm truth in civic life.  
- **Bastion of Aurex**: Spiritual heart of the Covenant. Oaths sworn in light are binding; priests of the Sun-Canon use mirrors to test truth, while Giants serve as Beacon-Wardens carrying sun-slabs to cliff shrines. Festivals of light such as the First Ignition and Beacon Pilgrimages center Aurex’s civic-religious calendar.
