Humans are found in every state across Velthuryn, but in certain regions they take on distinctive roles tied to local traditions, faiths, or politics. They are rarely dominant as a people, but consistently act as civic anchors, mediators, and lorekeepers.

## Specific Roles
- **Lexharrow**: Humans often hold positions of civic authority, administering law, trade, and Concord debates.  
- **Nokhul Vale**: Humans maintain most heir-roots of the Bone-Root Way and serve as scribes for Stone-Cantor law songs, making them central to ancestor-veneration and legal tradition.  
- **Ohlai Steppe**: Interwoven with orc clans, human lineages serve as healers, lorekeepers, and treaty recorders, preserving agreements at the Confluence of Banners.  
- **Aeterron**: Rise as merchant-princes and guild representatives, bridging Clank invention culture with external markets.  
- **Velkar Spires**: Act as traders and caravan leaders, ferrying goods down into Sunlash and inland to Aurex.  
- **Torral**: Integrated into coastal trade as market-wardens and tide-wardens, balancing Galapa patience with human adaptability.  
- **Bastion of Aurex**: Dominate priesthoods, heliograph engineering, and Sun-Court offices, anchoring Aurexâ€™s civic-religious order.  
- **Scorval Blight**: Appear as scarred refugees from Nokhul and Gravenreach, carrying fractured memory-songs into exile.  

## Patterns
Across Velthuryn, humans emerge as:  
- **Civic Anchors**: priests, scribes, engineers, officials.  
- **Mediators & Traders**: brokers between ancestries and states.  
- **Lorekeepers**: preservers of treaties, rites, and ancestral records.  
- **Survivors**: displaced peoples who carry traditions into exile.
