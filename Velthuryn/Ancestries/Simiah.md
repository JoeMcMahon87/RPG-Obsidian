Native to [[Tarkhos Dominion]], the Simiah are agile, rope-running people who measure worth by balance and daring.  
- Kinship groups called **Bands** dominate trade, espionage, and contract enforcement.  
- Rope duels and sky-dances are cultural pageantry and deadly contest alike.  
- Revered as Skyband Couriers: their seals and words are treated as binding law across Velthuryn.
