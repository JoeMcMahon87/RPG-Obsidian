Stone-bodied people deeply tied to the mountains and mesas of [[Velkar Spires]] and [[Thirasil]].  
- Shape stone with chants and geomancy.  
- Serve as builders of bridges, fortresses, and storm-foundries.  
- In Velkar, anchor citadels and carve stormglass shrines.  
- Their endurance is revered; oaths spoken by Earthkin are said to carry the weight of mountains.
