Elves, called the Time-Drifted, walk in two worlds: the waking and the remembered. They carry deep connections to memory, song, and star-cycles, often serving as archivists, oracles, and treaty-keepers. Their aging is mirrored by the stars, which many claim they can still hear singing.

## Specific Roles

- **Thirasil**: Homeland of the Elves. They claim descent from the Elderseed’s first sprout. Elves organize into wandering dusk-courts, singing law into memory-groves that drift with the forest. Their songlines guide travelers, and druids weave living roads, oath-bound wolves, and memory-seeds into civic and spiritual life.  
  - They host seasonal festivals such as the Root-Unfurling, Moonpetal Revel, Wander-Counting, and Vigil of the Dormant Heart, blending memory and star-rites into daily culture.
  - Hazards tied to Elves include wolf-rider tolls, griefglass mirage storms, and echo-thieves — some being outlaw Elves who steal memories.

- **Lexharrow**: Present in aristocratic courts and universities, Elves often serve as archivists of the Concord’s long memory. They dominate rhetorical contests at Aurenhold’s High Colleges, weaving illusion-texts as living debates.

- **Torral**: Elves interpret tides as omens of past lives, connecting the Dreamtide Chorus to Galapa tide-chanters. They are loreborne, reading both surf and star as cycles of remembrance.

- **Bastion of Aurex**: Elves appear in covenant courts as archivists and keepers of heliograph records, pairing their long memory with Aurex’s radiant law.

- **Velkar Spires**: Present in memory-shrines and storm-oracle courts, Elves are keepers of ephemeral windsongs and advisers in storm law.

- **Aeterron**: Elves are marginalized and distrusted as “irrational” by Clank authorities, their twilight logic dismissed as relic compared to iterative invention.

- **Sunlash Coast**: Elves keep coastal archives, particularly of star-charts and maritime treaties, aligning them with Tidekin in navigation and covenant-keeping.

## Patterns
- **Memory Keepers**: Archivists of treaties, law, and celestial cycles (Lexharrow, Aurex, Sunlash).  
- **Oracles of Nature**: Songline-guides, tide interpreters, and storm-oracle counselors (Thirasil, Torral, Velkar).  
- **Cultural Anchors**: Tie societies to remembrance and star cycles, ensuring continuity amid shifting lands.  
- **Marginalized in Aeterron**: Dismissed as irrational where invention and iteration dominate.
