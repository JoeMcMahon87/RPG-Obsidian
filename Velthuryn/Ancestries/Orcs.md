# Orcs
Orcs are oath-bound peoples, renowned for etching promises into flesh and steel. They appear across multiple states as oathkeepers, blade-poets, mercenaries, and raiders, their identity woven into ritual, ink, and fire.

## Specific Roles

- **Tarkhos Dominion**: Central to Tarkhos society. Orcs are oathkeepers, wardens, and smiths who temper embersteel with blood and promise. Their contracts, inked into skin or engraved into embersteel sheets, carry binding force as long as the plate or bearer endures

- **Ohlai Steppe**: Predominant lineage, leading riding clans and oath-tribes. They dominate the **Spirit-Races** and **Wind-Oath Trials**, serving as judges and competitors. Their banners mark migration trails like seasonal constellations, and their oath-tribes anchor nomadic law.

- **Nokhul Vale**: Orcs conduct funerary rites and dominate as Stone-Cantors, harmonizing the law into song carved on dolmens. They treat river flood-trials as binding oaths of honor.

- **Lexharrow**: Orcs hold prestige as **Ink-Oath Masters**, their sigils prized as incorruptible. Their oath-binding traditions merge seamlessly with Concord law, granting them authority in legal contracts.  

- **Gravenreach**: Serve as mercenary auxiliaries and oath-enforcers, their oath-tattoos often sworn alongside Drakona stele-oaths. Orcs are integral to military and legal enforcement.

- **Aeterron**: Employed as laborers or mercenaries, but rarely permitted citizenship. Orcish warbands roam the basalt wastes, guarding ember caravans or raiding into Nokhul Vale.

- **Velkar Spires**: Rare and often distrusted. Seen more as mercenary climbers or raiders than settlers.

- **Thirasil**: Appear as dusk-raiders along the frontier, sometimes hired as mercenaries but generally distrusted.

- **Scorval Blight**: Exiles from Tarkhos often become Blight-raiders, seeking redemption by braving griefglass storms, returning with trophies or dying in the attempt.

## Patterns
- **Oathkeepers and Judges**: Orcs embody the sanctity of promise â€” as Stone-Cantors, Ink-Oath Masters, and treaty judges.  
- **Martial Roles**: Mercenaries, raiders, and warband leaders, especially in Gravenreach, Aeterron, Velkar, and Scorval.  
- **Cultural Anchors**: In Ohlai, Nokhul, and Tarkhos, Orcs are central to spiritual, legal, and social structures.  
- **Marginalized Elsewhere**: In Thirasil and Velkar, Orcs are feared or distrusted as raiders, even when integrated into economies of mercenary work.
