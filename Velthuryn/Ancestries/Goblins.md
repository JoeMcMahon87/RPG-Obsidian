Goblins are restless innovators and reckless geniuses, embodying invention, spectacle, and chaos. They dominate the Fleaspark Union and appear in multiple other states as tinker-smiths, stormwrights, or opportunists. Known for treating failure as progress, they thrive in volatile communities and live for invention duels and civic spectacle.

## Specific Roles

- **Fleaspark Union**: Goblins are the **predominant ancestry**. They dominate spark-guilds, guild charters, and patent duels, shaping civic law as much as invention. Goblins serve as inventors, duelists, civic leaders, and Boomwrights aboard War-Skiffs (“Roaring Tincats”), chronicling explosions in Kaboom Logs. They anchor the Union’s anchor-cities:  
  - *Boomcradle*: Predominantly Goblins, central in patent courts and explosives crucibles
  - *Emberbank*: Goblins dominate guild-halls, though foundries run under Drakona hands
  - *Glassgear*: Goblins outnumber Clanks, turning precision into “guidelines”
  - *Sparkmire*: Goblins test hydro-alchemy alongside Ribbet and Simiah sages 
  - *Thunderhead Reach*: Goblin stormwrights anchor storm-forges and airship docks

- **Lexharrow**: Goblins are known for mercantile ingenuity, dominating patent courts and guild charters, leveraging Concord law to secure lasting wealth

- **Velkar Spires**: Present as windship engineers and lightning-rod tinkers. Their daring inventions sometimes rival Earthkin mastery but also risk catastrophe

- **Aeterron**: Goblins thrive as tinker-smiths and alchemists in the Dominion’s invention culture, embodying experimental risk-taking

- **Scorval Blight**: Appear as scavengers and smugglers, trading griefglass shards at ruinous cost. Their ingenuity often turns survival into spectacle

## Patterns
- **Core Innovators**: Goblins embody invention and civic chaos in Fleaspark, with every city doubling as a test lab.  
- **Patent Duelists**: They use invention duels as civic law in both Fleaspark and Lexharrow.  
- **Stormwrights**: Build skyships, storm-forges, and volatile alchemy in Velkar and Thunderhead Reach.  
- **Outsiders Elsewhere**: In Aeterron and Scorval they are tolerated or opportunistic, but rarely civic anchors.  
- **Cultural Ethos**: Failures are celebrated, recorded, and laughed at; progress is measured by explosions.
