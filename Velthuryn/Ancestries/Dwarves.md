Dwarves are one of the foundational ancestries of Velthuryn, deeply tied to stone, metal, and oath. They appear across many states in roles of resonance, law, and craft, often anchoring civic and spiritual life through their enduring traditions.

## Specific Roles

- **Gravenreach**: The heartland of dwarves. They carve contracts into granite tablets, sustain law through choral resonance, and believe truth has weight. Dwarves here are archivists of stone-song, with humor that burns slowly and reverence for ancestry and oath.  
  - They also serve as **Echo Wardens**, oath-sworn guardians who braid counter-hymns to steady the Wakewall Range against the Aethergrave’s encroachment.  
  - Festivals such as **Forge-Bloom** and **Echoforge Tourneys** center on dwarven forging and oath-choirs, granting authority in seasonal councils.  

- **Nokhul Vale**: Present as **Stone-Cantors**, inscribing rulings into fossil trunks where earth itself remembers, rejecting surface law.  

- **Torral**: An integrated minority, revered as metallurgists and covenant-steel crafters. Many serve as **forge-chanters**, blending hammer with hymn, though they defer to Galapa tide-law.  

- **Aeterron**: Serve as **resonance architects**, stabilizing forges and vaults, helping to regulate invention and secure civic infrastructure.  

- **Lexharrow**: Integral to craft guilds and engineering projects. They are famed for building bridges and aqueducts that knit the Concord together.  

- **Fleaspark Union**: Appear as brokers or adventurers, though rarely remain. In Emberbank, dwarves weary of Gravenreach’s strict law join goblins and drakona in industrial dock forges.  

## Patterns
- **Keepers of Oath and Law**: In Gravenreach and Nokhul, dwarves embody the weight of promises, inscribing them in stone and resonance.  
- **Masters of Forge and Resonance**: Across Torral, Aeterron, and Aurex’s neighbors, they are metallurgists and resonance engineers, binding hymn to hammer.  
- **Anchors of Infrastructure**: In Lexharrow, dwarves sustain civic works, creating aqueducts, bridges, and codified guild structures.  
- **Outliers and Exiles**: In Fleaspark, some escape Gravenreach’s rigid laws, joining volatile guild-halls or strike-forges.
