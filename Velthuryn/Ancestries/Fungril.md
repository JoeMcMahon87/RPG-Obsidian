Fungal folk native to [[Myrrun Hollow]] and resonance grottoes of [[Gravenreach]].  
- Bodies grown from spore-clusters, often with bioluminescent caps or fungal growths.  
- Revered and feared as memory-thieves â€” their spores can preserve or erase recollection.  
- In Myrrun Hollow, form symbiotic clans with echo-fungi, shaping subterranean law.  
- In Gravenreach, employed as alchemists, though always mistrusted.  
- Rare in [[Scorval Blight]], where griefglass corruption overwhelms their spores.
