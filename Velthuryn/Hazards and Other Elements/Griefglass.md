**Griefglass** is a resonance-charged crystalline substance found throughout Velthuryn and central to the events of *The Echo Below*.  It manifests as violet-hued shards, splinters, and veins that hum with memory and emotional residue.

---
## Properties
- Appears as translucent or mirror-like glass, often veined with violet light.  
- Holds **echoes of memory** — fragments of voices, oaths, or grief.  
- Can **whisper** to those nearby, replaying half-heard promises or betrayals.  
- Dangerous in storms, when splinters scatter and sow paranoia.  

---
## Uses
- Incorporated into **memory courts**, reliquaries, and contracts in states like Gravenreach and Lexharrow.  
- Cut into runes or shards for **ritual law and oath-binding**.  
- Sometimes carried as votive tokens, though often feared as cursed.  

---
## Hazards
- **Whispering Shards**: Splinters carry false voices, seeding mistrust.  
- **Mirage Storms**: Scatter echoes of past events that mislead or endanger travelers.  
- **Memory Theft**: Outlaws and Fungril alchemists harvest griefglass to steal recollections.  
- **Resonance Bleed**: Overexposure can erode personal identity or warp law and history.

---
## Cultural Significance
- In **Lexharrow**, griefglass fissures threaten the Concord’s written law — codices overwrite themselves under resonance flux.  
- In **Gravenreach**, dwarves mine **memory-ore**, a form of griefglass woven into oaths and lineage law.  
- In **Uled**, griefglass is tied to daily life, shaping the temple rites of the Mirrorwell and fueling the conspiracies behind the sabotage.

> **GM Note:** In play, griefglass should always feel like more than a resource — it is both tool and threat, shaping the fragile boundary between memory, law, and the echoes below.
