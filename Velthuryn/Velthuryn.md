## Overview

Velthuryn is a fractured, high-magic world built for heroic and emotionally resonant stories in the Daggerheart RPG system. Shaped by divine war, elemental upheaval, and echoing grief, Velthuryn offers explorers, warriors, scholars, and mystics the opportunity to uncover truths hidden within lands that dream, bleed, and resist.

Velthuryn circles a single copper-gold star called **Solivar**, whose radiant cycle governs the realm’s distinctive **30-hour “longbright”**: twenty hours of slanting daylight that ripens barkstone orchards and stirs tide-lilies to bloom, followed by ten hours of **deepglow**, a violet dusk when glowshroom caverns and [[[[Griefglass]]]] shards sparkle like scattered constellations on the face of the world. Scholars in the Prism-Forum of [[Bastion of Aurex]] track Solivar’s heartbeat in lens-etched ephemerides, claiming its pulses align with tectonic “breaths” beneath [[Myrrun Hollow]], while Way-singers of [[Nokhul Vale]] insist the sun’s lingering arc gives ancestors time to whisper through tap-roots before true night falls.

After Solivar slips beyond the Mellheiller horizon, twin moons rise to divide the dark. The elder moon Tassaryn, a vast pearl veined with storm-grey canyons ,commands the tides and features in [[Thirasil]] star-legends as the “Memory Mirror.” Its companion, the smaller ember-amber Cyressel, skims the heavens in a swift six-night cadence, kindling [[[[Griefglass]]]] reflections and sparking resonance storms along the [[Scorval Blight]] rim. When Tassaryn and Cyressel cross paths during the Sister’s Embrace eclipse, shadow plays writhe across Velthuryn’s seas, lighthouse heliographs dim to embers, and augurs from [[Sunlash Coast]] to [[[[Velkar Spires]]]] ready ink and incense to capture whatever omens the doubled night chooses to reveal.

Many ancestries and communities call these fourteen distinct states home, with eight complex religions making Velthuryn an expansive yet thematically cohesive realm. Magic permeates all things, hope and fear manifest as forces of change, and ancient powers stir within the lands' deepest wounds, especially within the [[The Aethergrave]].

## The Breath of the Land

Velthuryn is a world divided yet bound together by breath, tide, and stone. Its two continents face one another across the **Bangrave Sea**, a warm gulf that cleaves the realm in twain. To the north, the **Smithsoll Sea** gathers the Bangrave’s outflow into cold, echoing waters that scour the **Torral** promontory and the misted coasts of the **[[Velkar Spires]]**. To the south, the **Waters of Tunneau** lap the shores of **[[Lexharrow]]** and **[[Sunlash Coast]]** before mingling westward with the storm-fed **Mellheiller Ocean**. Inland, the **Sea of Lir** and the **Gulf of Wakewall** split and shape states along the western continent’s coasts, their tides carrying both wealth and woe.

### Western Continent

The western continent is framed by mountain chains and tidal gulfs, each shaping its states. To the north, the Northfang Range crowns the border between [[Scorval Blight]] and **[[Lexharrow]]**, its snow-bound ridges funneling polar winds south across savanna and desert. East of this, the Trine Peaks rise where Scorval, **Lexharrow**, and Fleaspark Union meet, knife-edged ridgelines hiding volcanic calderas whose rivers feed three realms at once. Farther south, the Wakewall Range forms the steep western wall of Gravenreach. Its sheer cliffs and landslide-scarred passes force caravans toward the Gulf of Wakewall, shaping trade as surely as stone.

Beyond these ranges lie broad belts of grassland, riparian forests, and the **[[The Aethergrave]]’s** violet fractures. Moisture borne off the Bangrave feeds fertile coasts, while drier winds inland sustain **Lexharrow’s** Meridian Bowl and **[[Tarkhos Dominion]]**-bound caravans. The western continent is a land of contrasts: storm-fed peninsulas, desert hearts, and mountain halls that echo with law.

### Eastern Continent

The eastern continent is dominated by the **Stonewail Rise**, a massive mountain arc where **[[Tarkhos Dominion]], [[Nokhul Vale]], [[Bastion of Aurex]], and [[Aeterron]]** meet. Its glaciers and high passes birth rivers that tumble into **Nokhul Vale’s** diamond-shaped lowlands or plunge toward **[[Myrrun Hollow]]** and the Bangrave coast. Along its eastern face, the **Aurex** **Highlands** spread in moss-clad ridges and copper-rich valleys, the gentler threshold before the stone’s true wall begins.

North of the Stonewail, alpine chains bend into the cloud-shrouded **[[Velkar Spires]]**, where storm-fed rivers carve their way to the coast. Southward, the **[[Ohlai Steppe]]** and **[[Thirasil]]** taper into tundra, ice, and forested shelves whose roots reach into the southern pole. Here, taiga, rainforests, and steppe mingle, fed by the seasonal cycle of cyclones from Mellheiller and snowmelt from the Rise.

## Climate & Currents

Velthuryn’s breath moves with its waters. Westerly winds sweep moisture across the **Waters of Tunneau**, greening the coasts of **[[Lexharrow]]** and **[[Sunlash Coast]]**. Trade winds off Mellheiller thunder north into the Spires and Rise, their spent rains falling soft upon **[[Myrrun Hollow]]**. Cold surges from the Smithsoll Sea carry brine and storm into **[[Torral]]** and [[Velkar Spires]]’s north coasts, while the Bangrave Sea’s warm tides knit east and west together.

Between mountain and sea, biomes shift rapidly: taiga belts fade into orchid-draped jungles; deserts lie ringed by grassland mosaics; wetlands stretch where estuaries meet volcanic loam. The land itself is restless, reshaped by tectonic pulses and **[[The Aethergrave]]** fractures that hum with violet resonance.
