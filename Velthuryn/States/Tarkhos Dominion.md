## Overview
Tarkhos is a realm forged in fire and oath. Its people measure worth by the endurance of their promises and the strength of their embersteel. Rope-running [[Simiah]] clans dominate its trade and politics, binding law and movement into one.

## Description
Tarkhos is a realm forged in fire and oath. Its people measure worth not by coin 
but by the temper of their steel and the endurance of their promises. Known 
across Velthuryn for embersteel, an alloy smelted in volcanic furnaces from ore 
veined through the Stonewail Rise, Tarkhos supplies half the continent with 
blades, ploughshares, and contracts etched into metal itself. Every caravan 
carries not just goods but law: scrolls engraved into embersteel sheets, 
untearable and fireproof, their clauses binding as long as the plate endures.

Tarkhos stretches across the northwestern corner of the eastern continent, bordered by [[Torral]] to 
the north, [[Nokhul Vale]] to the east, and [[Aeterron]] to the south. Its western shore opens onto the 
Bangrave Sea, dotted with shipyards and smelter-harbors that trade directly with [[Lexharrow]] 
across the gulf. To the east, Tarkhos shares a great interior lake with Nokhul Vale, its waters 
steaming in places where volcanic vents bubble beneath.

The land is a study in contrasts. Coastal harbors thrive where sea winds cool the ash plains, salt 
caravans hug the shoreline, and volcanic interiors roar with geysers and obsidian fields. The shared 
lake basin sustains fertile barley terraces and mushroom fields, doubling as bustling trade marts.  
Solivar’s longbright makes the ash plains shimmer red, while Tassaryn’s glow reflects in the 
volcanic lakes during deepglow — the **Twin Ember**, a sacred omen of Tarkhos.

## Capital
**Skarov’s Spine**: A city built in the fossilized ribs of a long-dead fire titan. Forge-terraces ring a caldera, their chimneys breathing crimson by longbright, while rope-latticed towers sway above ash-savanna winds. Here the forge-clans and rope-bands entwine, the Sunbellows smelting ore by day, and the Moonquench tempering blades by night.  
Skyband Couriers — rope-trained [[Simiah]] emissaries — carry contracts across Tarkhos faster than any rider. Their seal is binding as embersteel itself, feared and revered across Velthuryn.
