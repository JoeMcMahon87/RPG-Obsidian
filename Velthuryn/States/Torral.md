## Overview
Torral rests like a granite triangle at the northwestern edge of the eastern continent, its cliffs and shoals braced against the [[Bangrave Sea]]. To the south it meets [[Tarkhos Dominion]]’s ember-forged savannas; to the east, the storm-sculpted mesas of the [[Velkar Spires]]. Torral is shaped as much by tide as by stone, its people trace their lineage to the [[Galapa]], the great world-turtles whose shells still drift in slow convoys across the [[Bangrave Sea]], bearing cargo, homes, and shrines upon their living backs.
## Description
Torral’s lifeblood is tidesilver, a mutable alloy dredged from abyssal rifts and tempered by moonlit tidepools. In the Vale and beyond, it is said no weapon sings truer or ship-keel lasts longer than one laced with Torral tidesilver. Mining guilds anchor chains into the cliffs to lower entire foundries into tidal caverns, where smiths time their work by the surge and ebb of Solivar’s pull. Each forge is both workshop and shrine, for to waste tidesilver is sacrilege, its glimmer is the ocean’s memory of moons long past.
Culturally, Torral is maritime and ritual-bound. Tide-priests read the Bangrave’s surf like scripture, marking omens in the foam. Convoy-clans of Galapa-riders and shell-carvers bind themselves to oaths of tide and current, often voyaging for years before returning to landfall. Outsiders view them as austere, yet to Torral, every breath, every tide, is part of a covenant, with the moons, the sea, and the shell that carries them all.
## Capital
**Greatshell Haven**: A slow-roaming metropolis grown on the back of an ancient world-turtle, revered as kin and ancestor.  
- Scute-plazas rise and tilt with each stroke of the creature.  
- Tide-organs, vast pipes of tidesilver, bellow sea-deep chords that resonate across the bayous.  
- Galapa elders inscribe tidal runes into its shell, mapping Solivar’s arc and the twin moons.  
- Markets float on pontoon wharves; forge-docks, largely worked by Humans and Dwarves, bind covenant-steel in harmony with the tide-organs’ song.
- Drakona divers brave the drowned ziggurats during ebb-tides, returning with relics only the tide deems ready to surrender.
