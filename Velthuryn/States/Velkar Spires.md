## Overview
The Velkar Spires are storm-wracked mesas and glaciers rising like broken spears in the northeast of the eastern continent. Storms and resonance shape every aspect of life here, and oaths are tested against lightning, rope, and wind.

## Description
The Velkar Spires rise like broken spears from the northeast of the eastern continent, a sawtooth wall where storm and stone wage endless war. Clouds snarl perpetually around their snow-clad peaks, shot through with violet resonance when Solivar’s rays break across the glaciers. Rains and 
meltwaters cascade from these highlands, feeding the rivers of [[Nokhul Vale]] to the south and the fertile plains of [[Torral]] to the west. To the east, sheer cliffs plunge into the Bangrave Sea, their ports few and perilous, lashed by gales that batter ship and sailor alike.

Isolation defines the Spires. Rope-bridges sway over abyssal chasms; mountain monasteries cling 
like barnacles to stone faces; aerial patrols vanish into fog for weeks at a time. Yet their resonance-
rich heights draw seekers from every land: miners, sages, and oath-swearers who come to test 
themselves against storms that strip the false from the soul. To dwell in the Spires is to measure 
life by endurance — of rope, of vow, of breath.

The Velkari are famed storm-watchers and oath-binders. Their societies organize into sky-clans, 
each anchored to a citadel but bound by shared winds. Laws are declared in lightning-lit 
assemblies, where resonance crystals hum in agreement or fracture in dissent. To outsiders, 
Velkar seems a place of constant peril; to its people, the storms are scripture, and the peaks 
themselves are living covenant.

## Capital
**Zhirveth’s Roost**: A citadel-city perched on a knife-edged saddle where five wind-bridges converge.  
- Houses the Gale-Fanes, shrines of storm-glass that toll with each of Cyressel’s arcs.  
- The Aerium Foundries hang from chain-cranes, casting molten ore into the updrafts to create windsteel, a prized alloy exported to [[Gravenreach]] and [[Bastion of Aurex]].  
- The Roost Bazaar is a market suspended in perpetual drafts, trading thunder-opals, cloud-fleece, and resonance prisms.  

## Details

### Trade
- Windsteel, thunder-opals, stormglass, and resonance prisms exported to [[Lexharrow]], [[Aeterron]], and [[Bastion of Aurex]].  
- Imports food and grains from [[Torral]] and [[Nokhul Vale]].  
- Seasonal cloud-raft markets float between mesas, trading with [[Sunlash Coast]] smugglers.

### Religions
- [[[[Storm-Path Faith]]]] (local oath-binding storm worship — see below).
- Reverence for [[Sunvault Covenant]] (as Solivar’s lightning is seen as divine law).  
- Pilgrimages: Katari Moonfold Ascent and Earthkin Sky-Remembering Pathwalk.

### Culture
- Laws declared in lightning-lit assemblies.  
- Oathbinding ceremonies performed with resonance crystals.  
- Pathwalk pilgrimages by Giants, carrying memory-boulders into storms.  
- Katari glider pilgrimages during Verdant Zenith.  
- Life structured by weather: wind dictates trade, vows, and even marriage.

### Events & Hazards
- [[Storm-Wraith Corsairs]]: griefglass-masked raiders diving from thunderclouds.  
- [[Resonance Storms]]: sonic booms shattering bridges and cargo.  
- [[Lightning Leeches]]: winged predators draining charge from skyships.  
- [[Stone-Reckoners]]: oath-golems judging sigil-brands on storm-paths.  
- [[Avalanche Winds]]: sudden downdrafts collapsing caravans.  
- [[Cloud-Drakes]]: storm-dragons preying on herds and airships.  
- [[Vow-Flares]]: lightning striking oathbreakers in punishment.  
- [[Echo-Mire Ravines]]: gullies looping sound, trapping travelers in echoes.  

### Ancestries
- Majority: [[Earthkin]] — stone-bodied folk anchoring citadels into storm cliffs.  
- Minorities: [[Goblins]] (engineers and glider-makers), [[Humans]] (traders and caravaneers), [[Elves]] (windsong keepers).  
- Marginalized: [[Clanks]] (sometimes anchors, sometimes distrusted), [[Infernis]] (seen as imbalance to storm), [[Orcs]] (mercenaries and raiders).  


## Storm-Path Faith
The oath-binding storm-worship of the [[Velkar Spires]].  
- Teaches that storms strip away falsehood, leaving only the true oath.  
- Laws are declared in lightning-lit assemblies where resonance crystals confirm or fracture vows.  
- Pilgrimage rites include the Sky-Remembering Pathwalk of Giants and the Katari Moonfold Ascent.
