## Overview
Thirasil is a slow-walking forest: a land of colossal oaks, drifting fern-dunes, and root-bound laws tied to the buried [[Elderseed]]. Homeland of the [[Elves]], it is a federation of dusk-courts guided by memory and twilight rites.

## Description
Thirasil is not a kingdom so much as a slow-walking forest: colossi oaks 
whose roots unspool like caravan wheels, fern-dunes that drift on moss rafts, 
and orchid canopies that tilt toward ancestral constellations. Maps grow 
obsolete within a season, for the land itself meanders guided, druids claim, by 
the slumbering will of the Elderseed, an aeon-old world-heart buried deep 
beneath the timber sea. Those who listen to its pulse hear a basso thrum 
echoing through soil and bark, a rhythm echoed in the migrations of deer, fauns, dusk-wolves, and 
even the rivers themselves.

This is the ancestral homeland of the [[Elves]], who claim descent from the Elderseed’s first sprout. 
Their long memory and dusk-born sight make them stewards of this shifting dominion, organizing 
society into federated dusk-courts that wander with the forests. Each court sings its laws into the 
roots of memory-groves, so even when the land drifts, the law remains alive beneath their feet.

The Federation of Thirasil stretches across the southwestern corner of the eastern continent, 
where the last reaches of taiga fringe against the southern ice sheets. Its spruce ridges and tundra 
shelves stare west across the Bangrave Sea, while its southern shores fracture into icy marches 
and frost-fed estuaries that vanish into the polar mists. Winters clamp the soil beneath blue-white 
drift-ice so thick it hums when walked upon; summers melt the permafrost into glittering wetlands 
alive with cloud-geese and sapphire frogs.

## Capital
**Silvenvine, the Living City**: Suspended among the interlaced branches of the Amaranth 
World-Tree, Silvenvine rises and sinks with the tree’s yearly breathing. Each vernal equinox the city 
ascends several yards, revealing new terraces of bioluminescent lichen; each autumn it descends, 
allowing artisans to anchor fresh root-bridges and reinforce the city’s woven lattice.  
Silvenvine is both market and memory-archive: trade centers on dreambark vellum, lunar ink, and 
resonant crystals. Civic clocks here are calibrated not to Solivar’s arc but to petal-fall and eclipse, 
for in Thirasil time is measured not by the sun, but by the rhythm of the forest and the turning of shadow.

## Details

### Trade
- Dreambark vellum, lunar ink, resonant crystals.
- Timber, pelts, and spirits exported north to [[Aurex]] and east to [[Aeterron]].
- Fleaspark and [[Sunlash Coast]] traders sail across the Bangrave, but always as outsiders.

### Religions
- [[Elderseed]] — worshipped as the world-heart and source of law.
- [[Dreamtide Chorus]] — star and tide spirits tied to eclipses and twilight.
- Folk rites: ancestor-songs sung into memory-groves.

### Culture
- Grove-Weaving: living arches and halls coaxed from branches.
- Echo-Sap: resin recording ancestral voices.
- Wolf-Oath Bindings: dusk-wolves as oath anchors.
- Thirty-Hour Watchtowers: rotating beacon towers run by Elves.
- Memory-sapling rituals during the Root-Unfurling festival.

### Events & Hazards
- [[Wandertrees]]: walking groves blocking paths.
- [[Moss-Mire Tilts]]: sinkholes triggered by lunar tides.
- [[Verdant Wardens]]: ivy guardians binding trespassers.
- [[Twilight Avalanches]]: snow collapses under deepglow.
- [[Tundra Mires]]: thaw pockets swallowing sledges.

### Ancestries
- Majority: [[Elves]] – cultural rulers, dusk-courts, keepers of living law.
- Minorities: [[Halflings]] (dusk-wolf herders), [[Earthkin]] (builders, quarry workers), [[Humans]] (traders).
- Marginalized: [[Fungril]] (sporecraft kin), [[Infernis]] (fire is blasphemy), [[Orcs]] (raiders).
