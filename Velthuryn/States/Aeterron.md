## Overview
Aeterron is the Clockwork Republic — a realm where invention, iteration, and law are bound by the civic faith of the [[Clanks]]. Fire and ice, ash plains and glacial shelves, fuel a society that sees waste as sin and efficiency as sacred.

## Description
Aeterron is a realm of fire at war with ice. From the volcanic badlands of its northern heartlands to the frozen marches that grind down from the southern polar shelf, the land itself seems torn between extremes. Ash deserts stretch across the interior, where ember-cults carve obsidian shrines and orcish war-bands thunder across glass plains. To the south, glacial cliffs collapse into the fireglass flats, creating frozen rivers that hiss into steam as they strike molten vents.

The people of Aeterron live as if forged in the same crucible. They are oath-bound yet volatile, 
quick to brand betrayers with fire or cast out oath-breakers into the ice. [[Infernis]] lineages are 
numerous here, their flameborn ancestry treated not as curse but as proof of divine favor. [[Drakona]] 
auxiliaries patrol the volcanic ridges, while [[Orcs]] roam the basalt wastes, guarding ember 
caravans or raiding into [[Nokhul Vale]].

Despite its harshness, Aeterron is a vital hub: its windsteel and fireglass flow north into [[Bastion of Aurex]] beacons and [[Tarkhos Dominion]] forges, while its resonance charms are carried west through [[Thirasil]] into Bangrave markets. Every flame stoked, every shard of glass mined, every oath sworn is both weapon and currency. To outsiders, Aeterron is a land that devours itself; to its people, it is the furnace in which the world’s truest steel is tested.

## Capital
**Civitas Prime, the Reflective Metropolis**: A city where molten fire and glacial runoff are woven into a single civic engine. Chrome ziggurats rise above obsidian-plated canals, whose waters cool reactor-forges shimmering with violet resonance.  
- **Logic-Temples** host public experiments and debates.  
- **Mirror-Forums** project avatars of distant citizens for lawmaking.  
- Efficiency is creed: trams, condensers, and public festivals run with precision.  
- The city’s heartbeat is iteration — every invention tested, every error logged.  

## Details

### Trade
- Exports: logic cores, windsteel bearings, galvanic stone, resonance dampers, clock-vine seeds.  
- Partners: [[Gravenreach]] (memory-ore), [[Nokhul Vale]] (crops), [[Bastion of Aurex]] (beacon gems), [[Tarkhos Dominion]] (embersteel), [[Thirasil]] (wolf-hide leathers).  
- Imports: beacon gems, sun-gold, agricultural goods.  

### Religions
- [[Luminous Archive]] — revered through Logic-Temples and public codices.  
- [[Sunvault Covenant]] — invoked in heliograph experiments.  
- Civic cults: public iteration rites (Calibration, Iterant Games, Proof-Break).  

### Culture
- Iteration is sacred; waste is civic crime.  
- Public invention duels decide laws and guild dominance.  
- Festivals like the Calibration and Proof-Break test citizens’ ingenuity.  
- Marriages (Cog-Bond Ceremonies) swap gear-teeth vows, fitted into public orreries.  

### Events & Hazards
- [[Logic-Virii]] — rogue self-amending code infecting automatons.  
- [[Magnetic Tempests]] — storms erasing compass-bearings across Verbury Bay.  
- [[Protocol Tithe]] — newcomers must donate a mnemonic, recipe, or process.  
- [[Cog-Crimes]] — wasteful acts punished as civic crimes.  
- [[Glacial Collapse Zones]] — southern cliffs collapsing into volcanic vents.  
- [[Resonance Echo Trials]] — foreign contracts replayed in harmonic judgment.  
- [[Emberglass Smog]] — volcanic exhaust crystallizing into razor-dust clouds.  

### Ancestries
- Majority: [[Clanks]] — ideological heart of Aeterron, founders of the Republic.  
- Minorities: [[Humans]] (merchants), [[Goblins]] (tinker-smiths), [[Earthkin]] (forge stabilizers).  
- Marginalized: [[Elves]] (distrusted as irrational), [[Orcs]] (laborers and mercenaries), [[Infernis]] (persecuted flameborn).
