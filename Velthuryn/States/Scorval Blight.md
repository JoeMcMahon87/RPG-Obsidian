## Overview
Scorval Blight festers in the northwest corner of the western continent, where the polar ice presses down and the Mellheiller Ocean batters the coast. Once a green littoral, it was shattered by resonance storms bleeding down from the Aethergrave’s northern bay. Today, it is a realm of black ridges, frozen marshes, and griefglass wastes where memory itself falters:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Description
Its people are the castaways of Velthuryn — oath-breakers from [[Gravenreach]], archivists exiled from [[Lexharrow]], and [[Fleaspark Union]] inventors too reckless even for patent courts. Many turn to cult-circles that revere griefglass storms as oracles, or to raider-bands that scour borders for food and spark-goods.  

Neighbors both denounce and depend on the Blight:  
- [[Lexharrow]] secretly imports griefglass inks.  
- [[Fleaspark Union]] smugglers kite into storms for relics.  
- [[Gravenreach]] sends oath-choirs each thaw to burn corruption, though more shards emerge yearly.  

The Blight endures as a wound at the continent’s edge — where broken promises do not fade but freeze, humming in violet silence beneath the snow:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## Capital
**Veilspire, the Shard-Forged City**:  
- Towers scatter Solivar’s light into cruel violet rays by day.  
- At dusk, walls melt into cascades, alleys flow like rivers of glass, and districts slump from cliffs.  
- By Cyressel’s second arc, the city refreezes into a labyrinth no map can hold:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
