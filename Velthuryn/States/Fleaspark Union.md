## Overview
The Fleaspark Union is a confederation of caravans, workshops, and guilds spread along the northern shores of the Sea of Lir. It is a land where invention and recklessness go hand in hand — if it doesn’t explode, it isn’t progress.

## Description
The Fleaspark Union sprawls across the northern shores of the Sea of Lir, where storm-swept steppes meet rocky uplands. To the south, the lights of [[Gravenreach]] glow across the water; to the southeast, trade roads run down toward [[Lexharrow]]’s codices; to the west, spark caravans skirt the blighted frontier of [[Scorval Blight]].

It is not a kingdom but a confederation of caravans, workshops, and guilds, united only by their love of invention and their refusal to let law outpace experiment. [[Goblins]] and [[Gnomes]] dominate its spark-guilds, with [[Humans]] and [[Halflings]] joining caravans in exchange for a share of their volatile prosperity. Here, progress is measured in prototypes, not stability, and explosions are as common as festivals.

The Union’s wealth lies in its spark-mines, boom-powder, and experimental engines. Caravans 
cross the uplands hauling galvanic wheels, resonance kites, and unstable prototypes, bartering 
them in exchange for food, metals, and lawstone from neighbors. To live in Fleaspark is to live with 
risk-as-reward: when an invention fails, it fails spectacularly, but when it succeeds, it remakes 
trade itself.

Outsiders call Fleaspark reckless; its people call themselves unbroken by failure. In the Union, 
the motto is clear: “If it doesn’t blow up, it isn’t progress.”

## Capital
**The Five Anchor-Cities**:  
- **Boomcradle**: the Founding Spark, home of patent courts and nightly firework duels.  
- **Emberbank**: industrial docks refining slag from [[Tarkhos Dominion]].  
- **Glassgear**: labyrinth of labs and foundries, where every rooftop is a test site.  
- **Sparkmire**: swamp-forges powered by [[Ribbet]] engineers.  
- **Thunderhead Reach**: cliff-top storm-forges, harvesting raw lightning.  

Each city claims independence yet all share Fleaspark’s reckless brilliance.  

## Details

### Trade
- Exports: galvanic wheels, boom-powder, resonance kites, unstable prototypes.  
- Imports: food, metals, and lawstone from [[Gravenreach]] and [[Lexharrow]].  
- War-skiffs raid for embersteel slag along [[Tarkhos Dominion]]’s coast.  

### Religions
- [[Dreamtide Chorus]] (fey engineers and festival singers).  
- [[Choir of Glass]] (cult blending griefglass with invention).  
- Local cults worshiping failed inventions as “martyrs of progress.”  

### Culture
- Explosions are celebrated as invention rites.  
- Patent disputes settled with firework duels.  
- Outsiders must offer an invention — even a toy — to be considered guests.  
- Kaboom Logs record both triumphs and failures with equal pride.  

### Events & Hazards
- [[Patent Tollhouses]]: every caravan stop demands a “demonstration tithe.”  
- [[Boomwright Duels]]: disputes settled with fireworks.  
- [[Sparkstorms]]: chain-reaction detonations igniting across the uplands under Solivar’s glare.  

### Ancestries
- Majority: [[Goblins]] — reckless inventors and spark-guild leaders.  
- Prominent: [[Ribbet]] (canal-barge engineers), [[Clanks]] (regulators of invention-law), [[Humans]] and [[Halflings]] (caravan folk).  
- Minorities: [[Drakona]] exiles, stripped of clan-marks, working in forges.
