## Overview
The Nokhul Vale is a fertile, diamond-shaped lowland where rivers converge beneath the Stonewail Rise. Its people live in deep communion with ancestral voices whispered through roots and rivers, practicing the [[Bone-Root Way]] and spirit-song traditions.

## Description
The Nokhul Vale lies east of the Stonewail Rise, a diamond-shaped basin where rivers from the glaciers tumble into fertile lowlands. Its soils are rich, sustaining barley terraces, reed-farms, and spirit-groves that hum with ancestral resonance. To walk the Vale is to walk among voices: roots and waters carry whispers of the dead, offering guidance, warnings, or demands. The people honor these whispers with shrines, hearth-oaths, and seasonal offerings.  

The Vale borders [[Tarkhos Dominion]], [[Aeterron]], and [[Bastion of Aurex]]. Caravans flow through its heart, but every deal must appease the ancestors, lest the spirits curse the road.

## Capital
**Vale Settlements**: Nokhul has no single capital, but a network of fortified settlements clustered along rivers and ancestor groves. Each is ruled by hearth-clans and druidic councils who interpret ancestral whispers, turning memory into law. Their meeting halls are hung with griefglass tablets inscribed with oaths given to the dead.
