## Overview
The Bastion of Aurex crowns the southeastern cliffs of the eastern continent. Here, sunlight is not merely illumination but law itself, refracted, mirrored, and inscribed into every breath of civic life

## Description
Basalt promontories plunge into the Bangrave Sea while emerald rainforests press close from inland slopes. Aurex thrives on its mastery of sun-gold, prisms, and heliographs, bending light into signals, scripture, and binding decrees. Lighthouse-temples line the cliffs, their beams encoding edicts across the waves.  

To the Aurexi, Solivar’s light reveals truth; shadow is not absence but error. Entire pilgrimages are undertaken to witness the ignition of a new prism-lens or to walk cliffside shrines where vows are spoken aloud beneath blinding light. In Aurex, to speak in shadow is to lie, and to face the light is to bind oneself in covenant

## Capital
**Solarion Keep, Capital of Mirrors**:  
- Spirals upward like a helix of light, each tier lined with prism-gardens, beacon towers, and mirror-courts.  
- At dawn, the entire bastion erupts in brilliance, mirrors catching Solivar’s blaze and scattering it across the Bangrave.  
- At its heart rises the **Heliarch’s Spire**, a lighthouse-temple with the largest prism in Velthuryn. From here, edicts are cast in beams visible for miles, serving as both parliament and tribunal
