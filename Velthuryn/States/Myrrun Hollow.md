## Overview
Myrrun Hollow lies beneath the eastern coast of the eastern continent, where Velkar’s cedar forests sink into Nokhul’s river-fed foothills and the continent’s greatest river empties into the Bangrave Sea. To surface eyes it is a green delta, but beneath the loam and roots spreads a vast labyrinth of fungal caverns, fossil-forests, and spore-lit markets

## Description
The Hollow’s heartbeat is measured not by moonrise but by growth, rot, and renewal. Fungril colonies, Faun dreamers, Ribbet engineers, Firbolg orchard-tenders, Umbrin shadow-wrights, and Deep Dwarves weave their lives into bioluminescent cycles.  
- Walls drip with star-lichen that hums in resonance tones.  
- Bridges are spun from mushroom mycelium hardened like stone.  
- Laws are codified through the **Law of Rot**: decrees etched on bark or bone that decay naturally when their authority expires.  

Neighbors covet its goods: Nokhul Vale prizes dream-herbs and spores, Aurex tints beacon glyphs with fungal pigments, and Velkar traders barter for resonance mushrooms. River-ships carry fungal bricks and spore-candles abroad. Myrrun endures as a reminder that all things feed the cycle: flesh to fungus, memory to moss, law to loam

## Capital
**Beneath-Root, Capital of Spores & Silence**:  
- Built under colossal cedar roots forming civic halls and fungal amphitheaters.  
- Streets of hardened mycelium glow with drifting spores marking seasons of growth and decay.  
- At the heart lies the **Rot-Court**, where decrees are pressed into bark tablets and left to decompose; those that sprout lichens are considered blessed by the Hollow itself.  
- Surrounding are Spore-Markets trading memory-moss, dream-herbs, and fossil-wood relics. Fungi are said to overhear every bargain, reclaiming debts through mold-spirits

## Details

### Trade
- Glowshroom oil (cold-burning fuel).  
- Spore-silk (iridescent textiles).  
- Fungal bricks and spore-candles.  
- Exports coveted across [[Aeterron]], [[Lexharrow]], [[Sunlash Coast]], [[Velkar Spires]].  
- Hazards: spores clogging cogs, spore-fires, whispered debts

### Religions
- [[Bone-Root Way]] (Hollow Branch): ancestor-rot rites and rot-tapestries.  
- [[Spirits Between]]: folk animism; mushroom caps as spirit-doorways.  
- Spoor Cantors: Fungril sect singing into spore-chimes at each deepglow.  
- Amber Sleepers: Ribbet and Faun mystics immersed in root-amber

### Culture
- Decay is covenant: laws expire as bark rots, buildings shift as roots thicken.  
- Bloom-festivals mark seasonal cycles with spores, moths, and amber rites.  
- Outsiders risk confusion or fugue when exposed to bloom clouds or dream-moths

### Events & Hazards
- Hazards to outsiders: Spore Overload, Moth-Dread, Rot-Keening Echoes, Amber Misalignment
- Living Mysteries: Ever-Blooming Corpse, Whisper-Mold Choir, Hollow Sunspore, Root-Tongue Idol, Myco-Crypt

### Ancestries
- [[Dwarves]] — predominant stonemasons rejecting surface law.  
- [[Ribbet]] — amphibian guilds dominating canals, croak-choirs ferry civic votes.  
- [[Fungril]] — fungal artisans and archivists tending spore-archives.
- [[Fauns]] — caretakers of moss-terraces and memory gardens.  
- [[Firbolg]] — orchard-tenders, guarding unmarked groves
