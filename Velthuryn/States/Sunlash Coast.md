## Overview
The Sunlash Coast is a chain of coastal states stretched along the western continent, famed for their [[Tidekin]] ancestry, resonance beacons, and mastery of chronal navigation. Its fleets and lighthouse academies bind east and west through the Bangrave Sea.

## Description
The Sunlash Coast sprawls along the western continent’s shores, where the Waters of Tunneau meet the Bangrave Sea. The coast is dotted with port-cities, each ruled by Collegia guilds of Tidekin sages and human captains. Their beacon-lighthouses and chronal schools are indispensable for safe passage across resonance storms. 

Where [[Lexharrow]]’s law and [[Gravenreach]]’s stone might fracture, Sunlash binds Velthuryn together with trade. Yet its harbors are as dangerous as they are luminous, for chronal experiments sometimes spark temporal distortions — and the infamous war-sniffs patrol the docks, scenting out illicit griefglass and stolen prototypes.

## Capital
**Tidehaven**: A representative port-city of the Sunlash Coast, Tidehaven is a harbor of resonance lighthouses and Collegia lecture-halls. Its markets thrive on chronal devices, sea-gems, and imported vellum from [[Thirasil]]. Tidehaven is also known for its **Beacon Academy**, where Tidekin sages train new generations of beacon-keepers to guard ships from resonance storms.

## Details

### Trade
- Exports: beacon-gems, chronal devices, shipwright craft, tidal alchemy.  
- Imports: vellum and timber from [[Thirasil]], lawstone from [[Lexharrow]], memory-ore from [[Gravenreach]].  
- Fleets patrol the Bangrave, enforcing trade contracts and beacon rights.  

### Religions
- [[Sunvault Covenant]] — Solivar’s light as divine law, central to beacon-keeping.  
- [[Dreamtide Chorus]] — invoked during eclipses and resonance storms.  
- Minor Collegia cults revere the twin moons Tassaryn and Cyressel.  

### Culture
- Collegia guilds of Tidekin sages oversee both beacon law and commerce.  
- War-sniffs (trained hounds) patrol docks, able to scent temporal or griefglass anomalies.  
- Harbor festivals celebrate eclipses and the Sister’s Embrace.  
- Navigation rites are timed with Solivar’s longbright and deepglow cycles.  

### Events & Hazards
- [[War-Sniffs]] — resonance-trained hounds detecting smugglers.  
- [[Resonance Storms]] from the Bangrave threaten fleets and harbors.  
- Temporal distortions during eclipses, recorded in Collegia annals.  

### Ancestries
- Majority: [[Tidekin]] — sages, sailors, and beacon-keepers.  
- Minorities: [[Humans]], [[Elves]], [[Halflings]] (merchants and shipwrights).
