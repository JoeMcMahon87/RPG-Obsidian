## Overview
The Ohlai Steppe is a vast expanse of grassland and tundra, where clans of riders and shamans live by oath, spirit, and sky. It is the homeland of the [[Katari]], moonbound travelers whose pilgrimages shape the rhythms of the land.

## Description
The Ohlai Steppe stretches across the eastern continent south of [[Thirasil]] and north of [[Aeterron]].  
- Its endless plains are marked by totems, hearth-stones, and cairns that serve as both way-markers and shrines.  
- Seasonal migrations follow herds and spirit-signs, with entire hearth-camps uprooting to pursue ancestral omens.  
- The land is sacred to the [[Katari]], who claim it as the foundation of their Moonfold journeys, when they ascend during Verdant Zenith to glide into astral currents.  

To dwell in the Ohlai is to live with the ancestors’ breath at one’s back, and the ever-shifting spirits in the wind. Orcish warbands also roam the steppe, some hired as mercenaries, others feared as oath-breaker raiders.

## Capital
**Nomadic Hearth-Camps**: The Ohlai have no fixed capital. Instead, clans center their society on migratory camps of yurts and bone-frames, which gather seasonally for conclaves at spirit-stones. These conclaves act as law, festival, and trade combined — guided by shamans, Katari moon-singers, and elder orcs.
