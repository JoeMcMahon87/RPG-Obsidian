## Overview
A dominion of stone, fire, and sea. The Dwarves of Gravenreach mine echo-ore from the Wakewall Range, forging law into metal and memory into stone. The Sea of Lir and Bangrave coast make them as much a maritime people as mountain folk.

## Description
Gravenreach is a land of stone and fire, its dominion wrapped around the 
deep waters of the Sea of Lir and braced against the storm-lashed 
Bangrave coast. To the west, the Wakewall Range rises like a serrated 
fortress wall, cutting off [[Lexharrow]] and forcing trade south toward the Gulf 
of Wakewall, where ferries and fleets contend for passage into [[Sunlash Coast]] 
waters. To the north, [[Fleaspark Union]] shares the Sea of Lir’s shores, their 
capital lights often visible on clear nights across the water.

The people of Gravenreach are the Dwarves of the Forge-Vaults, stoic and 
exacting, who mine memory-ore from griefglass veins beneath the Wakewall and hammer it into 
contracts, heirlooms, and weapons that endure generations. Guild-houses act as both civil 
assemblies and extended families; every decision is struck on the anvil, every oath engraved in 
stone. To live in Gravenreach is to live with echoes, of hammer on ore, of avalanches across the 
Wakewall, of the past itself whispering through griefglass seams.

Though its forges blaze hotter than any other land, Gravenreach is as much a maritime realm as a 
mountain one. Its harbors along the Sea of Lir and Bangrave coast channel trade routes across 
both continents. To outsiders, it appears a bastion of iron and memory, but to its own people it is 
the beating heart of endurance, where stone and oath are indistinguishable.

## Capital
**Khalgur Forgevault**: Carved into the Wakewall cliffs overlooking the Sea of Lir, the city is less a settlement than a continent-spanning forge. Neighborhoods exist underground, clustered around vertical shafts where ore and embersteel are hoisted day and night. The Great Anvil Hall serves as both parliament and temple, where new laws are literally struck on the anvil, their resonance echoing into every home.

## Details

### Trade
- Memory-ore, embersteel ingots, basalt, and crafted oath-stones.
- Maritime trade across the Bangrave Sea, supplying [[Sunlash Coast]], [[Fleaspark Union]], and [[Lexharrow]].
- Stone-Seal Tokens and treaty-menhir inscriptions serve as exportable law.

### Religions
- [[Sunvault Covenant]] — Solivar’s radiant law, invoked in forge-lit rituals.
- [[Bone-Root Way]] — honored in mountain passes and oaths sworn into stone.
- Forge cults and ancestor rites tied to echo-ore veins.

### Culture
- Every law is struck upon an anvil and engraved into resonance stone.
- Guild-houses double as families and parliaments.
- Oathkeepers enforce treaties at prairie menhirs and sea-quays.
- Visitors welcomed if they honor oath-law and inscribe names in forge-guest tablets.

### Events & Hazards
- [[Echo-Ore Seams]] — dangerous veins that scream with broken vows.
- [[Harmonic Wells]] — resonant pools where dwarves test their lungs against tone.
- [[Prairie Menhirs]] — treaty-stones glowing with oath-echo flares.
- [[Aethergrave Encroachment]] — violet rift gnawing into Wakewall, threatening to erase law and memory.

### Ancestries
- Majority: [[Dwarves]] — forge-vault kin, lineage-clans called Eyries, binding oath to stone.
- Minorities: [[Orcs]] (mercenary oath-enforcers), [[Drakona]] (fortress keepers, oath-choirs), [[Humans]] (scribes and envoys).
- Marginalized: [[Faerie]] (seen as tricksters), [[Infernis]] (feared oath-breakers).
